how to implement version control using ‘GitHub Desktop,’ a Graphical User Interface for GitHub

At a basic level version control involves taking ‘snapshots’ of files at different stages. Many people will have introduced some sort of version control systems for files. Often this is done by saving different versions of the files. Something like this:

mydocument.txt

Version control tries to address problems like these by implementing a systematic approach to recording and managing changes in files. At its simplest, version control involves taking ‘snapshots’ of your file at different stages. This snapshot records information about when the snapshot was made but also about what changes occurred between different snapshots. This allows you to ‘rewind’ your file to an older version. From this basic aim of version control a range of other possibilities are made available.

I have been using git and github for quite sometime now. Its a great tool but I must admit there has been some confusion for beginners and frequent users as well. Then this tutorial is certainly a great place to learn the basics.  Its written in a very simple terms that both worlds can follow along without much problem.
