I the begining of the tutorial, I told you, we'll be using phpMyAdmin, well that was a truthful-lie to get you install our next to be development environment so as we'll be accessing and quering our database from a GUI interface. 

## Accessing MySQL via phpMyAdmin

In the lefthand pane of the main phpMyAdmin screen, you can click on the drop-down menu that says “(Databases)” to select any database you wish to work with. This will open the database and display its tables. From here you can perform all the main operations, such as creating new databases, adding tables, creating indexes, and much more. To read the supporting documentation for phpMyAdmin, visit https://docs.phpmyadmin.net.

In the next chapter, we’ll start looking at how to approach efficient database design, advanced SQL techniques, and MySQL functions and transactions.

MYSQL Clauses

***

#### 1. MySQL WHERE Clause

The WHERE clause allows you to specify the search condition for the rows returned by the query. The following shows the syntax of the WHERE clause:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
SELECT select_list FROM table_name WHERE search_condition;
```

# MYSQL DATA TYPES

I decided to make this a new series, cos understanding MYSQL datatypes is often misleading for beginniers. Having a solid foundation will go a long way in easy your pains and you'll thank me later. I'll cover the most commonly used data types so that you can quickly apply them effectively in designing database tables.

lets get started..

#### Understanding Data Types

A data type specifies a particular type of data, such as integer, floating-point, Boolean etc. A data type also specifies the possible values for that type, the operations that can be performed on that type and the way the values of that type are stored.

MYSQL datatye is broadly divided into three categories viz-a-viz

- (i) MySQL Numeric Types (ii) MySQL Date and Time and (iii) MySQL String Types

#### MySQL Numeric Types

***

The numeric datatypes take care of Integer types, Floating-Point Types, Fixed-Point Types and Bit Value Types. Integer types include INTEGER, SMALLINT. As an extension to the standard, MySQL also supports the integer types TINYINT, MEDIUMINT, and BIGINT. The keyword INT is a synonym for INTEGER. The FLOAT and DOUBLE types represent approximate numeric data values. MySQL uses four bytes for single-precision values and eight bytes for double-precision values.

Following table shows the required storage and range (maximum and minimum value for signed and unsigned integer) for each integer type.


***

Type | Length in Bytes | Min Value (Signed) |	Max Value (Signed) | Min Value (Unsigned)	| Max Value (Unsigned)
---- | --------------- | -------------      | ----------         | -------------        | ------------
TINYINT	| 1	| -128 | 127 | 0 | 255
SMALLINT | 2 | -32768 | 32767 |	0	| 65535
MEDIUMINT| 3 | -8388608 |	8388607 to | 0 | 16777215
INT	| 4	| -2147483648	| 2147483647 | 0 | 4294967295
BIGINT | 8 | -9223372036854775808	| 9223372036854775807	| 0	| 18446744073709551615
FLOAT	| 4	| -3.402823466E+38 | -1.175494351E-38	| 1.175494351E-38 |	3.402823466E+38
DOUBLE	| 8	| -1.7976931348623157E+308 | -2.2250738585072014E-308	| 0, and  2.2250738585072014E-308 |	1.7976931348623157E+308

#### DATETIME, DATE, and TIMESTAMP Types

***

The date and time types represent DATE, TIME, DATETIME, TIMESTAMP, and YEAR. Each type has a range of valid values, as well as a “zero” value. Recall MySQL uses yyyy-mm-dd format for storing a date value. This format is fixed and it is not possible to change it. However, custom settings could be achieved using DATE_FORMAT function. 

Types	| Description	| Display Format	| Range
----- | ------------| ---------       | ---------
DATETIME | Use when you need values containing both date and time information. | YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS | '1000-01-01 00:00:00' to '9999-12-31 23:59:59'.
DATE | Use when you need only date information.	| YYYY-MM-DD	| '1000-01-01' to '9999-12-31'.
TIMESTAMP	| Values are converted from the current time zone to UTC while storing and converted back from UTC to the current time zone when retrieved.	| YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS	| '1970-01-01 00:00:01' UTC to '2038-01-19 03:14:07' UTC

CHAR and VARCHAR Types

In Example 8-3, you may have noticed that three of the table’s fields were given the data type of VARCHAR, and one was given the type CHAR. The term VARCHAR stands for VARiable length CHARacter string, and the command takes a numeric value that tells MySQL the maximum length allowed for a string stored in this field. 

The CHAR and VARCHAR types are similar but differ in the way they are stored and retrieved. They also differ in maximum length and in whether trailing spaces are retained.

Types	Description	Display Format	Range in characters
CHAR	Contains non-binary strings. Length is fixed as you declare while creating a table. When stored, they are right-padded with spaces to the specified length.	Trailing spaces are removed.	The length can be any value from 0 to 255.
VARCHAR	Contains non-binary strings. Columns are variable-length strings.	As stored.	A value from 0 to 255 before MySQL 5.0.3, and 0 to 65,535 in 5.0.3 and later versions.

adapted from https://www.w3resource.com/mysql/mysql-data-types.php


BLOB and TEXT Types

A BLOB is a binary large object that can hold a variable amount of data. There are four types of BLOB, TINYBLOB, BLOB, MEDIUMBLOB, and LONGBLOB. These differ only in the maximum length of the values they can hold. 
The four TEXT types are TINYTEXT, TEXT, MEDIUMTEXT, and LONGTEXT. These correspond to the four BLOB types and have the same maximum lengths and storage requirements.

Types	| Description	| Categories | Range
----  | ----------- | ---------- | -------
BLOB	| Large binary object that containing a variable amount of data. Values are treated as binary strings.You don't need to specify length while creating a column.	
TINYBLOB	Maximum length of 255 characters.
MEDIUMBLOB	Maximum length of 16777215 characters.
LONGBLOB	Maximum length of 4294967295 characters
TEXT	Values are treated as character strings having a character set.	TINYBLOB	Maximum length of 255 characters.
MEDIUMBLOB	Maximum length of 16777215 characters.
LONGBLOB	Maximum length of 4294967295 characters

Difference between MySQL Datetime and Timestamp data Types

The DATETIME type is used when you need values containing both date and time information. MySQL retrieves and displays DATETIME values in ‘YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS’ format. The supported range is 1000-01-01 00:00:00' to '9999-12-31 23:59:59'.

The TIMESTAMP data type is also used when you need values containing both date and time information. TIMESTAMP has a range of '1970-01-01 00:00:01' UTC to '2038-01-19 03:14:07' UTC

The major difference between DATETIME and TIMESTAMP is that TIMESTAMP values are converted from the current time zone to UTC while storing, and converted back from UTC to the current time zone when retrieved. The datetime data type value is unchanged.

See the following example :

The following command displays current time zone information :

# MYSQL IMPORT & EXPORT

Import a CSV File Into a Table

This tutorial shows you how to use the LOAD DATA INFILE statement to import CSV file into MySQL table.

The  LOAD DATA INFILE statement allows you to read data from a text file and import the file’s data into a database table very fast.

Before importing the file, you need to prepare the following:

A database table to which the data from the file will be imported.
A CSV file with data that matches with the number of columns of the table and the type of data in each column.
The account, which connects to the MySQL database server, has FILE and INSERT privileges.
Suppose we have a table named discounts with the following structure:

discounts table

We use CREATE TABLE statement to create the discounts table as follows:

CREATE TABLE discounts (
    id INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
    title VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    expired_date DATE NOT NULL,
    amount DECIMAL(10 , 2 ) NULL,
    PRIMARY KEY (id)
);
The following  discounts.csv file contains the first line as column headings and other three lines of data.

discount csv file

The following statement imports data from the  c:\tmp\discounts.csv file into the discounts table.

LOAD DATA INFILE 'c:/tmp/discounts.csv' 
INTO TABLE discounts 
FIELDS TERMINATED BY ',' 
ENCLOSED BY '"'
LINES TERMINATED BY '\n'
IGNORE 1 ROWS;
The field of the file is terminated by a comma indicated by  FIELD TERMINATED BY ',' and enclosed by double quotation marks specified by ENCLOSED BY '" ‘.

Each line of the CSV file is terminated by a newline character indicated by LINES TERMINATED BY '\n' .

Because the file has the first line that contains the column headings, which should not be imported into the table, therefore we ignore it by specifying  IGNORE 1 ROWS option.

Now, we can check the discounts table to see whether the data is imported.

SELECT * FROM discounts;
discounts table data

Transforming data while importing
Sometimes the format of the data does not match the target columns in the table. In simple cases, you can transform it by using the SET clause in the  LOAD DATA INFILE statement.

Suppose the expired date column in the  discount_2.csv file is in  mm/dd/yyyy format.

discount_2.csv file

When importing data into the discounts table, we have to transform it into MySQL date format by using str_to_date() function as follows:

LOAD DATA INFILE 'c:/tmp/discounts_2.csv'
INTO TABLE discounts
FIELDS TERMINATED BY ',' ENCLOSED BY '"'
LINES TERMINATED BY '\n'
IGNORE 1 ROWS
(title,@expired_date,amount)
SET expired_date = STR_TO_DATE(@expired_date, '%m/%d/%Y');
Importing file from client to a remote MySQL database server
It is possible to import data from client (local computer) to a remote MySQL database server using the LOAD DATA INFILE statement.

When you use the LOCAL option in the LOAD DATA INFILE , the client program reads the file on the client and sends it to the MySQL server. The file will be uploaded into the database server operating system’s temporary folder e.g.,  C:\windows\temp on Windows or  /tmp on Linux. This folder is not configurable or determined by MySQL.

Let’s take a look at the following example:


LOAD DATA LOCAL INFILE  'c:/tmp/discounts.csv'
INTO TABLE discounts
FIELDS TERMINATED BY ',' 
ENCLOSED BY '"'
LINES TERMINATED BY '\n'
IGNORE 1 ROWS;
The only difference is the LOCAL option in the statement. If you load a big CSV file, you will see that with the LOCAL option, it will be a little bit slower to load the file because it takes time to transfer the file to the database server.

The account that connects to MySQL server doesn’t need to have the FILE privilege to import the file when you use the LOCAL option.

Importing the file from client to a remote database server using  LOAD DATA LOCAL has some security issues that you should be aware of to avoid potential security risks.

Importing CSV file using MySQL Workbench
MySQL workbench provides a tool to import data into a table. It allows you to edit data before making changes.

The following are steps that you want to import data into a table:

Open table to which the data is loaded.

mysql workbench import csv

Click Import button, choose a CSV file and click Open button

import csv into mysql

Review the data, click Apply button.

edit table content

Review Data

MySQL workbench will display a dialog  “Apply SQL Script to Database”, click Apply button to insert data into the table.

We have shown you how to import CSV into MySQL table using LOAD DATA LOCAL and using MySQL Workbench. With these techniques, you can load data from other text file formats such as tab-delimited.


Export a Table to a CSV File

Summary: in this tutorial, you will learn various techniques of how to export a MySQL table to a CSV file.

The CSV stands for comma separated values. You often use the CSV file format to exchange data between applications such as Microsoft Excel, Open Office, Google Docs, etc.

It will be useful to have data from MySQL database in CSV file format because you can analyze and format the data in the way you want.

MySQL provides an easy way to export the query’s result into a CSV file that resides in the database server.

Before exporting data, you must ensure that:

The MySQL server’s process has the write access to the target folder that contains the target CSV file.
The target CSV file must not exist.
The following query selects cancelled orders from the  orders table:


SELECT 
    orderNumber, status, orderDate, requiredDate, comments
FROM
    orders
WHERE
    status = 'Cancelled';
To export this result set into a CSV file, you add some clauses to the query above as follows:

SELECT 
    orderNumber, status, orderDate, requiredDate, comments
FROM
    orders
WHERE
    status = 'Cancelled' 
INTO OUTFILE 'C:/tmp/cancelled_orders.csv' 
FIELDS ENCLOSED BY '"' 
TERMINATED BY ';' 
ESCAPED BY '"' 
LINES TERMINATED BY '\r\n';
The statement created a CSV file named  cancelled_orders.csv in the  C:\tmp folder that contains the result set.

The CSV file contains lines of rows in the result set. Each line is terminated by a sequence of carriage return and a line feed character specified by the LINES TERMINATED BY '\r\n' clause. Each line contains values of each column of the row in the result set.

Each value is enclosed by double quotation marks indicated by  FIELDS ENCLOSED BY '”' clause. This prevents the value that may contain a comma (,) will be interpreted as the field separator. When enclosing the values by the double quotation marks, the commas inside the value are not recognized as the field separators.

Exporting data to a CSV file whose filename contains timestamp
You often need to export data into a CSV file whose name contains timestamp at which the file is created. To do so, you need to use the MySQL prepared statement.

The following commands export the whole orders table into a CSV file with timestamp as a part of the file name.


SET @TS = DATE_FORMAT(NOW(),'_%Y_%m_%d_%H_%i_%s');
 
SET @FOLDER = 'c:/tmp/';
SET @PREFIX = 'orders';
SET @EXT    = '.csv';
 
SET @CMD = CONCAT("SELECT * FROM orders INTO OUTFILE '",@FOLDER,@PREFIX,@TS,@EXT,
    "' FIELDS ENCLOSED BY '\"' TERMINATED BY ';' ESCAPED BY '\"'",
    "  LINES TERMINATED BY '\r\n';");
 
PREPARE statement FROM @CMD;
 
EXECUTE statement;
Let’s examine the commands above in more detail.

First, we constructed a query with current timestamp as a part of the file name.
Second, we prepared the statement for execution by using PREPARE statement FROM command.
Third, we executed the statement by using the EXECUTE command.
You can wrap the command by an event and schedule the event run periodically if needed.

Exporting data with column headings
It would be convenient if the CSV file contains the first line as the column headings so that the file is more understandable.

To add the column headings, you need to use the UNION statement as follows:

(SELECT 'Order Number','Order Date','Status')
UNION 
(SELECT orderNumber,orderDate, status
FROM orders
INTO OUTFILE 'C:/tmp/orders.csv'
FIELDS ENCLOSED BY '"' TERMINATED BY ';' ESCAPED BY '"'
LINES TERMINATED BY '\r\n');
As the query showed, you need to include the column heading of every column.

Handling NULL values
In case the values in the result set contain NULL values, the target file will contain  "N instead of NULL. To fix this issue, you need to replace the NULL value by another value e.g., not applicable ( N/A ) by using the IFNULL function as the following query:

SELECT 
    orderNumber, orderDate, IFNULL(shippedDate, 'N/A')
FROM
    orders INTO OUTFILE 'C:/tmp/orders2.csv' 
    FIELDS ENCLOSED BY '"' 
    TERMINATED BY ';' 
    ESCAPED BY '"' LINES 
    TERMINATED BY '\r\n';
We replaced NULL values in the shippedDate column by the  N/A strings. The CSV file shows  N/A instead of NULL values.

Exporting data to CSV file using MySQL Workbench
In case you don’t have access to the database server to get the exported CSV file, you can use MySQL Workbench to export the result set of a query to a CSV file in your local computer as follows:

First, execute a query get its result set.
Second, from the result panel, click “export recordset to an external file”. The result set is also known as a recordset.
Third, a new dialog displays. It asks you for a filename and file format. Enter the file name, choose CSV as the file format and click Save button.
MySQL Export Table to CSV

The CSV file exported by MySQL Workbench supports column headings, NULL values and other great features.

Big Cinemas
MovieTickets.com
Fandango

Add features to manage seat maps, upcoming movies, screening location, and other critical details. This will turn your ticket reservation software into an advanced online movie ticket booking system.

3. UX Focused Booking: Your movie discovery and booking site should be built with concepts of UX in mind. To make the website user friendly, you ought to plan each website section very carefully. The process to book tickets include: Seat selection, Payment options, Final checkout

The option to save your card details will quicken payments.

4. Payment Module: Enable payments through debit cards, credit cards, net banking and quick cash options.
